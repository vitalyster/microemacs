    files is present in the system.

  * Lots of minor issues resolved and stability further improved.

  [090905] Added a pause of 0.25 sec  before  exiting  when using -o option on
           windows, if file is a temporary one the launching application could
           have deleted the file before the me server loads it.

  [090213] Improved  indent  rules so two  'current-line  and  onward'  tokens
           together   are  both   considered   on  the   current   line,  i.e.
           '</tr></table>' is a double indent.

  [090201] Fixed  the 'No to all' 'o'  option to fill  paragraph  prompt,  was
           still 'v' for Never.

  [090201] Avoided  crash  caused  by moving  reg node to itself or one of its
           children.

  [090121] Better support for encrypted notes files, checks the first line and

           password.

  [081204] Fixed get-next-line buffer selection (logic inverted).

  [081204] Fixed file-tool-menu so it will work in a *find* buffer.

  [081111] Changed  the default  behaviour  of open and view to open a menu if
           more than one Open/View tool matches.

  [081111] Added alias paths to a '~' auto-completion list.

  [081111] Fixed compile buffer processor often missing error lines.

  [081106] Changed  file tool mask so if it starts  with '^...' the whole file
           name is matched not just the base name  (required for  'http://...'
           type matching).

  [081106] Remove  file tool setup from the  context  menu as it is now in the
           file tool menu itself.

  [081106] Document highlighting; improved the hilighting of http & https urls
           and added file: hilighting.

  [081106] Added a new 'Find Link'  mouse  command  (use  user-setup  to bind)
           which  will open the  file/url  clicked on by the mouse  (typically
           bind to Ctrl Left mouse)

  [081106] Added 'File Tool Setup' to the file tool context menu.

  [081026] Added confirmation  prompt if about to save a file which had binary

           prompt)

  [081024] Improved  the  get-next-line  file name  template to be more strict
           with matching drive letters at the start.

  [081019] Improved behaviour when ftp reg file is missing.

  [081019] Ensured   large   files  are  handled   properly   (fails  for  .Ht
           replace-string-in-files 3 ) and improved error reporting.

  [081018] Fixed  "find-file" so it can load files and directories with square
           brackets (i.e. a[b])

  [081010] Removed compile highlighting as this is now done differently.

  [081010] Changed favorite file opening to check for a default open file-tool
           and use that instead.

           no-wrap bit 0x200.

  [081005] Implemented  a more macro  orientated  interface  to  get-next-line
           (when n == 0), which only looks in the  current  buffer, if a 'next
           line'  is  found  it  simply  changes  the  cursor  location,  sets
           next-file & next-line variables and does not pop-open the file. Got
           get-next-line to set :next-line as well as a next-file variable.

  [081005] "find"  and "grep"  used new  '&bstat o' to check  that any  loaded
           buffer used (-l) is up-to-date and if not prompt the user.

  [081005] "find" and "grep" introduced -a option to automatically  reread all
           ood  buffers  (Yes to All) and -o option  to never  reread  the ood
           buffers (NO to all)

  [081005] Changed  shell-tool  interface so a tool can run concurrent without
           going  to  a  buffer  (uses  relatively   recent   improvements  to
           shell-command)

  [081005] Changed   reread-all   command  so  default   action  only  rereads
           out-of-date  buffers  (uses new  &bstat) if 0 arg is given  then it
           rereads all as before.

  [081005] Protected ME from potential crash when homedir is NULL.

  [081002] File types, fixed abort caused by empty files.

  [081002] page-file;  implemented  a new -u/-U  option to limit the size of a
           file to be grep'd to 100Mb unless -u is given (unlimited,  includes
           -w for find)

  [081002] When a large file is encountered find & grep now use page-file.

  [081002] Fixed pressing C-g at read-only  prompt of  replace-string-in-files
           to abort the command.

  [081002] page-file; Implemented an absolute line counter which works as long
           as the user started from the top (v useful for grep)

  [081002] page-file;  Implemented a macro orientated  page-file-search-buffer
           macro.

  [081002] page-file;  Added support for specifying the buffer name to be used
           by page-file (0 numeric arg)

  [081002] isearch  macros now have an 'Yes to All' option when asked  whether
           to change page.

  [081002] Increased the default page size to 1Mb

  [081002] Restricted  the session kill history to only buffers which are 1020
           chars long or less.

  [081002] Added @y0 ... @y15 support to directly extract the kill-ring buffers.

  [081002] Added a new &bstat command  variable which is similar to &statt for
           the current buffer, currently only has 'o' for 'out-of-date' test.

  [081002] Made double click on a window  mode-line delete other windows (i.e.
           maximise the window)

  [0801002] Fixed opening toolbar when notes was active in the session.

  [081002] tools; added new save-kbd-macro command which makes it easy to save
           a keyboard macro for future use.

  [081002] xfind;  use  new  0x200  ipipe  flag  to  not  wrap  lines,  avoids
           get-next-line failures on long file names.

  [080929] Changed the 0 & +ve args for reyank, now acts as a yank yanking out
           the nth item in the kill  ring  (i.e. 0 reyank == yank  (except  no
           external clip check))

  [080929] Fixed bug in isearch - C-w was not  storing  status so a  following
           backspace could lose the Okay status.

  [080916] find/grep -& (background) option working with new -f ME option.

  [080916] Added Windows MSVC 8 makefile

  [080916] Fixed pipe  failure  problem  caused by  GetConsoleScreenBufferInfo
           failing (no console) this is a fatal problem whe not in piping mode
           - not checking for failure and handling led to use of uninitialized
           variables.

  [080724] Fixed spin in ctags caused by a double '; ;'

  [080724] Added new 'Tag File' option to the generate-tags dialog

           modified'  test, 0x02  disables the main prompt,  added new 'delete
           inactive buffers' prompt with bit 0x04 to disable.

  [071125] Fixed  clearcase  -mkbranch  files  being  given '?' status.  Fixed
           cc-merge refresh bug.

  [071103] Build;  added -D option to specify a define,  e.g. -D _USETPARM  to
           use the systems tparm function rather than ME's

  [070311] 2dos, 2mac,  2unix, 2win; use arg 0 as these are not able to prompt
           from the user if the file is read-only - just do it.

  [071103] cc-delete; removed bogus 'checking out parent' error message.

  [071021] find;  added -&  support  to  replace-sting-in-files  and added new
           *replace*  output  buffer for the  command so hte user can see what
           has been done.

           character (i.e. not just a base name).

  [070923] Fixed ftp file rename (i.e. 'r' command in ftp dir listing)

  [070923] Only  rename  dir-list  buffer to *files* if the current  buffer is
           called  *files* (i.e. browser is being used). Handle a dirlist (not
           called  *files*) being  displayed in multiple  windows.  Added file
           being loaded to file history.

  [070923] jst; Added support for tables being terminated by a ]? on the start
           of the last row, this makes tables far easier to use.

  [270923] jst; Added  support for  item-list  and  collapse.  Added 4th level
           titles.

  [070920] Persist wrap mode in  ipipe-rerun  and disable  compile  hilighting
           when wrap is not used as very long compile  lines kill  performance
           (ME takes a lot of CPU)

  [070920] Reset  hilight and indent buffer  variables on a bclear,  otherwise
           the  hilighting   persists  in  *compile*  buffer  across  multiple
           compiles etc

  [070920] Added a bit 0x02 to the  compile  command to run the ipipe  command
           without  wrap  (required  if  '<filename>:<line>:  Error' lines are
           longer than the window width)

  [070920] Fixed html comment definition (should be <!--  -->)

  [070920] jst; improved title.

  [070920] Added new 0x0200 bit to ipip-shell-command to disable wrap, similar
           to raw but  still  adds the  header  and exit  info.  Need this for
           compile  when file  names are  longer  than the width of the window
           (breaks goto-next).

  [070920] Fixed  build.sh  to  build  mec when X11 is not  available  - issue
           raised by TH.

  [070920] Added  capability to  'set-variable @y ...' to set the current kill
           buffer.

  [070524] Added a new 0x20 flag to  find-buffer  to stop the  history  of the
           outgoing buffer from being  incremented - used by new find and grep
           to avoid trashing the buffer history.

  [070524] Fixed the handling of find-buffer's -ve arg, introducing a new 0x10
           bit flag to control the forced hiding.

  [070524] Fixed file name input so  trailing  '/.' & '/..' have a further '/'
           added, this fixes several file loading problems.

  [070524] Changed  file  saving  prompts to be like  delete-buffer,  they now
           given the file name  first and then the 'save  file'  prompt so the
           user can always see the action they are being prompted for.

  [070524] Added an f3 buffer binding to be the same as v.

  [070524] Improved  filetype.emf  to report if the last line is  missing  its

           mode-line arrows (like paged tools in toolbar)

  [070426] Avoid  opening the toolbar twice which can cause tool window sizing
           issues.

  [070425] Fixed cc-state end process cursor positioning prompt, now moves the
           cursor  to after  the  [***....]  exit  line so the user  knows its

  [061205] Implemented new  (query-)replace-string-in-files  commands based on
           new find. Changed default for grep to not use -l (use find-setup to
           do this). Changed -x option so it always ignores auto-save files.

  [061205] Fixed   console/window   session   variable  muddle,  two  run-mode
           variables are now kept separate.

  [061205] Added new find-setup comand

  [061105] Fixed word wrap horizontal scroll when using a window that is a few
           characters  wider than the fill column.  Caused next line to scroll

  [061105] Fixed the Win32s  Windows build which was using a later day Windows
           construct.

  [061105] Fixed NanoEmacs Window version under MS-Windows,  crashing on start

    [061004] Changed $timestamp default to be regex compliant (i.e. \\\\.)

    [061004] Changed copyrights to 2006

    [061002] jst - Up-dated jst hook and utils to latest standard.

    [061002] Changed  arg  to  popup-window  from 3 to 4 to  resize  as  well,
             restoring a session on a different  machine  could  easily  break
             things otherwise.

    [061002] browse mode - Added wheel mouse support.

    [061002] notes - fixed  notes-file bug caused by creating a new notes file
             while in notes. Close notes before importing skwurel notes.

    [061002] Fixed find bug.

    [061002] Improved  the  $file-names   path/regex  division  detection  and
             checked  for '\\<'  which  can  always  be used as a  divider  if
             required.

    [060928] Fixed crash caused by ftp login being given a NULL password.

    [060927] Set macro  version to 2006-09-09 as the release  version. Set the

             width allows.

    [060921] Browser.  Added  seconds  to  the  info  given  for a  file  in a
             directory  listing. Fixed dir list hooks to handle mod times with
             seconds.

    [060921] Changed char prompts to have '/' dividers.

    [060921] Added new bit 0x20 to read-file to discard changes to buffer.

    [060919] Build.  Added  $MAKEWINDEFS  and LIBS to the  ME_WINDOW  defines,
             removed  references  to xpm from the  makefiles  as this is not a
             standard  package  and  moved  references  out  of  emain.h  into
             unixterm.c.  Vamped up build shell  script to check for X11 & Xpm
             availability. Changed horrid dos style empty string tests in UNIX
             scripts with -z & -n test options

    [060918] Standardized  the form of  character  input  prompts and improved
             routine so '?' swaps  between  help and prompt.  Added a 'N(o) to
             all' option to  save-some-buffers  and changed  fill-pharagraph's
             'Never' to 'N(o) to all'. For query-replace, changed the help for
             '!' to 'Yes to  (a)ll'  and  added  'a',  changed  'i' to 'e' and
             removed '.' option.

    [060918] Changed  debugger '!' to 'c', in keeping with other debuggers for
             'continue'.

    [060918] Added bit 0x04 to @mc flag so macro can supply a help string

    [060917] Corrected the X-Windows  ordering to allow us to receive  (Un)Map
             events  on  Linux -  X-Server  behavior  is  different  from  Sun
             Solaris.

    [060917] UNIX. Added XPM colour bitmap  support. Just smartens the ME icon
             up in Gnome and makes ME look a bit more 21st century without the
             monochrome icon.

    [060917] Shell template, addition of missing common commands.

    [060917] JST, addition of other text insertions.

    [060917] UNIX. Corrected X-Windows positioning from popup-window.

    [060917] Added  new  48x48  icon for  gnome  with  transparency  boarder -
             complaints that existing icons were not Gnome friendly!

    [060917] UNIX. Corrected  X-Windows  hints for font size change.  Requires
             that  the  X-Window  is  unmapped  before  the  size  hint may be
             modified and the re-mapped.

    [060915] Notes. Fixed next-frame prefered selection order.

    [060915] OSD.  Sanitised  the quick  file open and file type  buffer  open
             menus  and  changed   them  to  use  a  scrolled   list  if  more
             files/buffers than lines rather than filling the screen.

    [060915] In notes  find a file that is loaded  but out of date, this leads
             to an reread  prompt during which the notes  ehook/idle  callback
             kicks in and changes frame - this breaks the message line of both
             frames. This is a rather horrid fix to a rather grotty problem!

    [060915] Browser,  fixed  the  sort  order to be case  sensitive  on UNIX,
             insensitive on Windows

    [060914] User setup.  Stopped  user-setup's  Apply from losing the current
             session's override colour scheme

    [060914] ClearCase.  Fixed  Describe  context menu hotkey  overload.  Used
             -mkpath to implement a 'checkout parent' for cc-add.

    [060913] Notes.  Fixed the  loosing  of edit and crypt  mode from the main
             notes  buffer due to the  setting of the major mode. Fixed  notes
             tree context menu hot keys.

    [060913] Fixed kill-list tool up-date trashing the real kill ring.

    [060912] Changed session-update to store view mode for a buffer only if it
             was forced on by the user (i.e. the file is not  readonly).  This
             stops  files  re-loading  in view  mode if the  permissions  have
             changed - this was a problem  with  ClearCase  reported  by Enver
             Haase.

    [060912] Simplified  the new  note-setup and fixed the notes buffer losing
             the hide mode (which causes problems for session restore).

    [060911] Removed  the notes  'note'  dummy  hook in favour of using a real
             hook.  Set the  default  hook to be jst but can be set in the -!-
             enf;  major-mode:  <hook> -!- header. Added new note-setup  which
             users  buffer-setup  to allow  the user to setup the  buffer  and
             stores the values for that note.

    [060908] File browser, bound a file-attrib  based 'Change File Attributes'
             option to 'g'

    [060908] Changed  file-attrib to handle directory  buffers  correctly and,
             with a numeric  arg of 0, change  the  attibutes  of a given file
             (i.e. not the current buffer) Implementation  changed to now have
             a Cancel button.

    [060908] File tool,  implemented  new %"...%" tag to enable proper quoting
             of arguments.

    [060907] Fixed startup buffer  hilighting issue caused by order of session
             restore.

    [060905] ColdFusion   template,  added  sting   highlighting  to  the  SQL
             statements.

    [060905] File browser, added binary edit, bound to 'b'.

    [060905] Added  basic xml "/>" single tag  support to html and fixed xml's
             insert-attrib to handle this

    [060905] Changed    refences   to   white-char*   to   whitespaces   (i.e.
             display-white-chars  -> display-whitespace)  Fixed hide main menu
             to popup an info dialog informing the user how to get it back.

    [060905] Fixed ftp dialog to conform to new <user>.erf  setup  standard by
             adding a new 'Make Default' dialog, and improved the behaviour of
             Enter in the dialog.

    [060904] Corrected the ColdFusion closing bracket hgilight.

    [060904] Shortened the document template formating menu text strings.

    [060829] Fixed HTML  template  html-insert-tag  to add the  closing "/" on
             insertion of a "<singleTag/>". Fixed  html-insert-attrib  to deal
             with attribute insertion into a HTML tag ending in "/>".

    [060828] SQL Template. Corrected SQL string hilighting.

    [060827] New  language  template  for  Adobe/MacroMedia  ColdFusion  (file
             extensions .cfm, .cfml .cfc).

    [060827] Extended indentation with the 'u' and 'v' indentation types.

    [060822] 2006 RC1 Release.

    [060822] Added     password     commands      "password-to-phonic"     and
             "insert-password".

    [060816] Added    settings    for   fill-col   and    fill-mode   to   the
             major-mode-setup.

    [060816] Added support for a .fhook-???.fill-*  variable and changed latex
             over to using this variable  rather than burning the fill-mode in
             as 'l'

    [060816] Crossword - Changed Exit button to Close.

    [060816] Changed organizer Exit buttons to Close or Cancel.

    [060812] Additions to the PHP script - missing tags etc.

    [060812] Corrected sun keysym  inclusion - inclusion  limited to X-Windows
             build only

    [060811] Fixed session resize issue and incremented the version.

    [060811] Added $buffer-fill-* variables to the buffer-setup dialog

    [060811] Stopped  read-session  warning about the *server*  buffer being a
             process.

    [060811] Updated to use the new $buffer-fill-*  variables - simplifies the
             doc hooks as ehooks and bhooks are no longer required.

    [060811] Incremented the version. MicroEmacs 06 - Date 2006/08/10 - sunos

    [060811] Introduced new $buffer-fill-col & $buffer-fill-mode  variables to
             allow every  buffer to have its own setting,  initialized  to the
             global variable value when the buffer is created.

    [060810] Added 'a' for All option to the save-some-buffers prompt

    [060810] Added  save ->  prompt  -> delete  of all  buffers  when  loading
             another  session. If bit 1 in arg is not set (i.e. 0 read-session
             "name") then this is not done and the new session is  effectively
             merged into the current.

    [060810] Added setting of main buffer modes to the buffer-setup osd.

    [060807] Updated emulation modes to handle the new main menu.

    [060807] Fixed major mode drop down list to not scroll horizontally

    [060807] A few tweaks to help with the other editor emulation.

    [060807] Fixed major-mode-setup so Cancel cancels all changes (was 50-50)

    [060807] Removed old buffer-setup file and fixed the makefile

    [060807] Removed 'correction' of main osd - not needed and wrong.

    [060807] Tweaks  to osd to  remove a few  annoyances:  up on main menu now
             goes to last item of current sub menu, fixed  re-frame  and focus
             issue on an opened  child and made C-g always  just close a child
             even if not in focus.

    [060803] Added  new -2 and -3  values  for  2nd  arg to  &lins  to  insert
             alphabetically and case insensitive alpha.

    [060803] Added setting of the major mode to the new buffer-setup

    [060803] Changed osd dialogs to use 'Cancel' or 'Close' rather than 'Exit'

    [060803] Closed notes if open when  applying  changes as this corrupts the
             notes frame.

    [060803] Made the buffer sub-menu be case insensitively ordered in windows
             and have first letter hotkeys.

    [060803] Changed  frame-id  comparison to use seq as should handle "ERROR"
             better.

    [060803] Fixed notes to handle a reread-file type operation.

    [060803] Changed osd dialogs to use 'Cancel' or 'Close' rather than 'Exit'

    [060802] Added  saving the session to save-all  and  associated  a file in
             $user-path with the File->New command.

    [060801] Set .gz  extracted  buffer name and file name so its  location is
             kept.

    [060728] Fixed clear-case to handle multi-line  comments with SHELL set to
             csh.

    [060728] Changed  "symbol"  to   "insert-symbol"   and  "indent-setup"  to
             "buffer-setup"  as  this  is  what  it will  become.  Fixed a few
             hot-key issues with new main menu.

    [060728] Improved help page and looked for context-menu binding to support
             esc +.

    [060728] Moved the location of making CVS and clear-case  always available
             into their setup dialog and added a C-x C-q replacement option.

    [060728] Changed  backspace in a directory to move to the sub-directory in
             the parent listing.

    [060728] Fixed notes startup so it returns the user to the same place.

    [060728] Documentation, replaced -ve with negative and +ve with positive.

    [060726] gdiff.  Added  termcap  friendly  key  bindings  to move  between
             difference regions.

    [060726] Added  new  indent-increase  and  indent-decrease  macros.  Added
             indent  increase and decrease to format, changed notes binding to
             f8, move shell  tools from tools to advanced  and setup  commands
             into tools.

    [060726] Fixed setting of scheme when session file does not exist (problem
             hit when old user uses session for first time)

    [060725] Changed goto commands to not stop the show-region highlight

    [060725] Major  rearrangement  of the main menu,  replaced  the Insert and
             Execute  sub-menus  with a View  and  Advanced,  re-balanced  and
             relocated  many items, most notably the setup dialogs out of Help
             into Advanced.

    [060725] Renamed the  existing  tool-bar  macro to  toolbar-open  (mirrors
             existing  toolbar-close) and introduced a new tool-bar macro that
             toggles state, i.e. closes if opened. This command is more useful
             in key-bindings and menus etc.

    [060725] Improved  error  handling  of osd  based  find  tag, also  adding
             support for tags file being in a parent directory.

    [060725] Removed   command-line   validation   and  relax  file  selection
             requirement  so user can  create a tool  that does not  require a
             file name (e.g. open . in explorer)

    [060725] Used  set/goto-position  to  store  current  dot  and  added  <no
             favorites> entry if menu is empty.

    [060725] Added hot-keys to the file attrib dialog

    [060725] Changed  simply  fence  matching of quotes and double  quotes, if
             match is not  found by the end or start of the line it's  assumed
             to be a single and ignored.

    [060725] Changed &mid so the 3rd argument (length) can be -ve to mean from
             the  right (as per the &rig etc) - not sure why this was not done
             first time round.

    [060624] Changed  session  support  to  handle  both  window  and  console
             environments. Changed startup to only initialize one scheme.

    [060623] Added file-type-setup to the list of misc setups.

    [060622] Changed   buffer-setup   to   major-mode-setup,    also   changed
             buffer-help  to  major-mode-help  etc and  fixed  comments.  Left
             buffer-setup  in  buffstp as there will be a  buffer-setup  which
             really does setup up the current  buffer.  Change  me.emf date to
             20060606

    [060620] Stopped session trying to change the frame for a console run.

    [060619] Sessions.  Stopped restore buffer's whose file does not exist and
             changed  the order of frame size  setting so on UNIX the depth of
             windows are maintained correctly

    [060619] Notes. Fixed  current  buffer  position  reset problem  caused by
             buffer being shown on hidden notes frame

    [060619] Changed  all ME setup  macros  to reload  the  /history  registry
             before  change  the  registry  and  writing it out as soon as the
             changes are accepted to reduce the  likelihood of settings  (like
             new alias  paths) being lost. One except is when the setup is run
             from within  user-setup  in which case the  registry is only read
             and written by  user-setup,  this could have some  unwanted  side
             effects. Added session-setup to the user-setup misc page.

    [060619] Change to allow macros access to inactive  buffers broke file and
             ipipe hooks which get executed but the buffer is officially  made
             active - fixed  by  maintaining  the  BIFNACT  internal  flag and
             ensuring the algorithm used for inactive  buffers is only used wh
             ere  appropriate.  Found buffer context was not set correctly for
             session  buffers  whose name was set to  'name<1>' as the BIFNAME
             flag is not set, fixed by  removing  this flag and using  code to
             assess if the <1> should be removed based on the filename.

    [060619] Fixed read-registry's replace mode which was doing a merge as the
             old node was not removed.

    [060619] Fixed a bad  prompt  and added a couple of  brackets  to  protect
             compare order.

    [060616] Changed  the  start-up  process to not use the  history  commands
             (which  have  been  removed)  but  simply  use the  read-registry
             commands.

    [060615] Moved the  storage of all history  type info into the new session
             (esf) files.

    [060615] $user-name.erf  only  contains  setup  info and not often  edited
             changed user setup to minimize the likelihood of losing edits (at
             last).

    [060615] Broken session-setup out into its own macro file and made quite a
             few fixes to the new session support.

    [060615] Removed the save- & read-history commands the me.emf start-up now
             simply use the read-registry command

    [060615] Changed  find-buffer to allow limited access to inactive  buffers
             (allows base getting and setting of variables)

    [060615] Changed the exit-emacs numeric argument (again) so it can be used
             by meDie (0x28 exit-emacs ~= emergency exit)

    [060615] Created new  $window-mark-line & $window-mark-col to aid inactive
             buffer support (not sure why these were not already there as they
             are usefully in macros)

    [060615] Enabled  availability of save-some-buffers by default (quick-exit
             relies on this!)

    [060615] Changed  the -c  command-line  option to simply set the  variable
             %session-name (relies on session macros)

    [060615] Changed clipboard support to not mess with it during start-up and
             shut-down

    [060615] Created new change-scheme command.

    [060615] ClearCase.  Fixed  *cc-state*  buffer not being in view mode when
             command completes.

    [060615] Corrected types of exchange-point-and-mark.

    [060608] Improved OSD search dialog by making the buttons  always  enabled
             and reporting an error if search string is empty.

    [060608] Made the existing hidden scheme macro a visible command which can
             be used to change the current  color scheme. Set  .scheme.current
             to the file name of the current  scheme Saved the current  scheme
             in a  session  so a user  can  create  a  session  with  its  own
             different scheme.

    [060526] Sessions. Changed to use new shut-down pseudo key.

    [060526] Changed  shut-down  process  to call the  ehooks for the  current
             buffer of all frames and changed the shut-down  macro to a pseudo
             key-binding.

    [060525] Added a new  buffer-major-mode  command  to  change  the  current
             buffer's hook, giving it an arg of -1 or major mode of "" removes
             the hook. No completion list yet. Fixed tab-width  setting so all
             3 windows get the same new value.

    [060525] Changed  gdiff to insert the 2 files into temp  buffers so if the
             files  are  already  loaded  by the user  these  buffers  are not
             effected. Added the ability to set the tab width.

    [060525] Fixed crash caused by watch  refreshing  the buffer while user is
             using isearch - stopped watch from refreshing the buffer.

    [060525] Added a new bit 0x10 to find- read- and  view-file to disable the
             context fhook evaluation.

    [060525] UNIX  fix. Call  screenUpdate  directly  after a window  resize -
             fixes gdiff update problem.

    [060523] Sessions. First serious rev of session-load and -save.

    [060523] Added arg to  tool-bar  to allow the  tool-bar to be  initialized
             without  re-reading  the  registry  -  required  by  new  session
             support.

    [060523] Changed  left  click on mode line to change to the  window if the
             mouse is not moved.

    [060523] Fixed C++  '::<function>() ;' indentation bug introduced with c++
             initialize ': <base-init> ()' indentation support.

    [060523] Encrypted  files. Added  file/host to the password prompt so on a
             -c the user should know which password is required.

    [060523] Fixed UNIX compiler warnings

    [060516] me.emf. Fixed missing def of file-type-setup & shell-tool-setup.

    [060515] Added new bit 0x2 to arg for  change-buffer-name  which force the
             buffer to have the given name,  changing  the name of an existing
             buffer if required.

    [060512] ClearCase.  Fixed  cc-setup view  deletion,  pressing No does not
             remove it. Removed the temporary  file created by cc-diff if me's
             diff of gdiff are used, file is still left if xdiff is used.

    [060512] Added a new $mode-chars  variable which returns the letter ids of
             all modes as a string, this variable cannot currently be set.

    [060512] Changed    the   numeric    arguments    for    quick-exit    and
             save-buffers-exit-emacs to make them simple to use.

    [060510] Improved  the ftp logging so errors get put into the console with
             error numbers rather than just  mlwrite'd.  Removed the KEEPALIVE
             as ME closes the  sockets  with  10mins  anyway. Fix the ftp kb/s
             calc.

    [060510] Dirlist.  Fixed  context menu so the FTP  additions are added for
             any ftp:// listing.

    [060504] Major  addition  to  notes:  a)  Added  forw/back  note. b) added
             notes-instant and notes-context c) implemented notes-session-save
             (not done window  layout yet) but not  implemented  the  matching
             load yet. d) fixed a few annoying up-date and behavior problems.

    [060504] ClearCase.  Fixed  windows  \\r\\n issue with diff -  constructed
             predecessor could have the wrong format breaking the diff.

    [060504] Changed  reyank  numeric arg so if a -ve arg is given reyank will
             fail if at the end of the kill chain  rather than loop - required
             for notes-session-save

    [060504] Found  differences  between  copy and  kill-region's  handling of
             narrows,  particularly  if  there's no markup  line Found I could
             crash ME if only the end part of a  narrow-to  is killed - buffer
             line  number  all go  wrong. To fix the  issues  I've  created  a
             standard  function  to handle  the  expansion  of narrows  over a
             region and made the rule that for a narrow  without a markup line
             to be  included  in the  region at least the \\n of the  previous
             line and 1 char of the  container  line  must be  included,  this
             means that narrows at the top and bottom cannot be included.

    [060504] ClearCase. Fixed cc-merge comment bug.

    [060504] Added support for a .ascii-time.format variable which defines the
             format  for the output  using '%' tags as per  strftime  function
             (supports  most tags) - output is  unchanged  if  variable is not
             set. Fixes  request by Dick  Pierce.  Changed the OSD insert time
             function to use the same tokens and made the first  format in the
             list be the output of ascii-time.

    [060503] Provided  macro  interface  to get a list of alpha  marks for the
             current buffer.

    [060427] Fixed  context-menu  element  activation issue caused by selected
             file count being wrong.

    [060427] Fixed notes and gdiff window resize issues by locking the size.

    [060426] Improved  (but not quite fully fixed and I don't think I can) the
             mouse word  selection when the word is half hidden at the left or
             right edge of the window.

    [060425] Fixed  bug with  setting  $window-line,  if value is < 1 then the
             goto-line  function prompts the user, this is incorrect  behavior
             for a set variable  command and the cause of a mouse driver spin.
             Fixed mouse left button spin caused by missing the pick event and
             a bug in  set-variable  for  $window-line.  Added new  horizontal
             scroll feature when user clicks on a $window-char  truncated line
             char.

    [060421] JSP. Fixed java <%...%> within JavaScript start token

    [060421] Fixed C++ comment hilighting

    [060413] Added an  abort-command  safty  trap to reset  the  $buffer-input
             variable.

    [060413] JSP. Fixed most JSP hilight and indent  issues caused by java and
             javascript confusions.

    [060412] Bug fix. Put  checks in to ensure the  hilight/indent  to be used
             according  to a look-back  scheme has been  defined - fixes crash
             when viewing JSP files.

    [060403] DIRECTORY LISTING. Fixed 'not-exist' fix in last commit - ftp dir
             lists  can  be  only  a  couple  of  lines  Made   file/dir  copy
             automatically  try 3 times before  prompting  the user (large ftp
             copies will fail at points). Fixed browse mode close problem when
             browse deletes the buffer.

    [060402] Used an ehook and a callback to auto detect a change in the notes
             frame  buffer/window  layout, if there is a change  the  callback
             closes the notes frame. This approach resolves many issues.

    [060331] Fixed XML magic hook.

    [060331] Fix annoying  find-zfile  last buffer history change. Changed the
             buffer & file  name of a  loaded  zfile  file to  something  more
             useful.

    [060331] Created a '2 find-buffer <file-name>' arg which finds an existing
             buffer via its file name - used to fix annoying find-zfile buffer
             history change.

    [060330] Fixed CVS & CC context menu placement issues. Fixed cc-add to use
             -mkpath for directories

    [060330] Change fhook-dir to always detect if its a source-controlled  dir
             and call the SC hook,  the SC hook can then add its own  bindings
             etc. Fixed  fhook-dir  so  loading of  ".../not-exist/"  does not
             error.

    [060330] Made the esc = & esc + menu bindings global.

    [060329] Changed unix  start-up mode to favor X over termcap if DISPLAY is
             set, even if term is a vt100.

    [060329] Fixed mode-line udate bug when all edits are undone - reported by
             Tom Hundt.

    [060322] Fixed the  position  of the context  menu when opened by mouse or
             menu key. Fixed  auto-spell not being available when context menu
             is opened using the menu key.

    [060322] Improved  gdiff-next  command  to error at the end of the file so
             the use knows they have reached the end. Bound 'menu' to open the
             contex  menu  and  bound  'esc up' & 'esc  down' to move  between
             unassigned sections.

    [060322] Bound  f10 to close  the  notes  frame  and  bound C-x k to a new
             notes-delete command

    [060317] ClearCase.  Added new cc-merge  command  (which uses  cleartool's
             findmerge  command!).  Added new cc-describe  command (which uses
             cleartool's describe command), fixed the CC context menu.

    [060317] Directory listing. Increased 2Gb directory file size limit to 4Gb
             by making size variables meUInt.

    [060317] Fixed '\\' quoting in command-wait example.

    [060316] Up-dated  docs for  command-wait,  added some meaty  examples and
             added cross references to them.

    [060316] indent fix

    [060316] Changed  describe-word  osd  dialog  so  that it has a 'Look  Up'
             button which is the default. Also improved the insert description
             process so C-w kills the description inserted.

    [060316] Improved  the  behaviour  of the  enter key in the help osd so it
             does a search or nothing.

    [060315] Fixed a win32  console  crash caused by the new frame  reposition
             function.  Stopped the messing about of the windows  console when
             ME is in piped mode.

    [060309] Fixed  regex \\a -> \\g for bell and added  support for \\a & \\m
             to [...] character classes.

    [060309] Updated *shell-command docs.

    [060309] Documented &lef, &mid & &rig -ve 2nd arg usage.

    [060309] Documented insert-string's -ve arg.

    [060309] Up-dated goto-matching-fence docs

    [060309] Fixed docs for when no arg is given to forward-kill-word.

    [060309] Updated jst template to new version.  Fixed a couple of bugs with
             tables (empty cells and bad indent)  Implemented a table cell '!'
             flag to  indicate  a start of a row (helps  debugging)  Fixed bug
             when title variable not set.

    [060309] ClearCase. Minor improvement to setup layout

    [060222] Exit handling fixed, saving of modified  buffers,  history, spell
             dictionaries etc. "**Emergency Exit**" messages removed from exit
             handling.

    [060214] Corrected user setup mouse defaults - missing wheel mouse default
             bindings.

    [060214] Improved the php look-back scheme to identify php script quicker.

    [060213] Fixed crash  caused by the new hilight look back scheme using the
             indent look back  function  which used the indent  scheme  rather
             than the hilight scheme

    [060210] Improved php hilighting by making use of the new look-back-scheme
             and look-back-only-token features.

    [060210] Improved the time printout

    [060210] Benchmark tests. Improved the disptest.

    [060210] ClearCase. Fixed cc-add when adding just a directory.

    [060210] Added basic mouse support to browser and honours exit bindings

    [060210] Added  look-back-scheme  support to hilighting (uses same code as
             indents  quick-lookback  scheme).  Added  new  'only  use  during
             look-back' hilight token (combined 0x800 & 0x200) which can solve
             make multi-line string hilighting issues.

    [060210] Fixed compiler warning with -m changes

    [060210] Removed unused variable in new reposition function

    [060210] Fixed unused variable on NDEBUG build

    [060209] Made changes to the -m server  message  option to make it usable.
             a) Process the message using teh macro 'token' function so \\n is
             translated  to  a  new-line  char.  b)  If  the  message  is  not
             terminated  with a \\n then  one is  added.  c) The  popup-window
             message it only given when -o option is used

    [060209] Added support for a server 'M' message command.

    [060209] Changed  the  hilight  and indent  meHilight  structure  mis-uses
             access the data via #define  (added to  estruct.h) so the code is
             clean and easy to read and the miss uses can be easily  found and
             changed.  Changed  the  storage  of the main  indent and  hilight
             scheme flags to use the ignore field (only 5 bits currently used)
             so the trunc  scheme can use the type and the  hilight  look back
             can use the close (i.e. unlimited).

    [060209] Fixed clear-case update list on checkin option.

    [060208] Fixed   crash   caused  by   mlGetStringFromUser   being   called
             recursively  -  only  possible  since  the  introduction  of  ftp
             completion which can prompt for the user password while inputting
             a file name.

    [060207] Added an implementation of meFrameRepositionWindow for XTerm, not
             a very good one as there is not a clear standard between WMs.

    [060207] Fixed  obscure  crash caused by horizonal  scroll mode 2 and long
             lines.

    [060202] Build script. Fixed MS-Window's typo.

    [060201] ClearCase + CVS. Fixed hiding of *??-console*  buffer and closing
             the window with loading a file from a dir list.

    [060127] Broke the  user-setup  'Tools' 'File Types' and 'EMail' pages out
             into separate  independent setup dialogs. Added new Miscellaneous
             page to  user-setup  with links to these and other setup  dialogs
             (such as  alias-path  and  file-tool)  Changed the buttons to the
             more standard  Okay, Apply Cancel.  Slightly  changed some of the
             Mail & VM  registry  settings to make each  platform  independent
             (except filtering).

    [060127] ClearCase.  Added new  cc-delete and  alias-path-setup  commands.
             Added f4 to diff  binding.  Moved  the  window  resizing  call to
             nearer the end (after the font  resize as this could  change to a
             smaller font allowing more lines etc).

    [060127] Fixed  quite  a  few  issues  with  the  CVS  and  clear-case  UI
             interfaces.  Brought  cvs-state  into  line with CC,  implemented
             cc-delete and rationalised the hot-keys and context menus.

    [060127] Added new alias-path-setup OSD gui.

    [060127] Added new 3 & 4 arg to  popup-window to manipulate the main frame
             window, implemented meFrameRepositionWindow function on windows.

    [060127] Fixed find-reg index in error message.

    [060127] Moved macro  parser's \\a to \\g (bell) and added support for \\a
             - alpha and \\m - alpha-num to hilight and regex.

    [060125] Changed the default debug for 'deb' abbrev to 2.

    [060125] Improved the hilighting of html &???; chars - issue raised by Tom
             Hundt

    [060124] Fixed crash  caused by moving right  (cursor key) into a sub-menu
             with no active items - bug found by Tom Hundt.

    [060122] gdiff.  Fixed the bugs  introduced  with the 3rd  'current  line'
             window was introduced.

    [060122] Changed  call from  saveExitEmacs  to exitEmacs to avoid  compile
             errors for NE.

    [060122] Fixed the meDie function to not exit straight after the emergency
             exit message, now autosaves as it should.  Change the handling of
             the CLOSE message on windows so it prompts okay/cancel if buffers
             need saving and then exits. Fixed really annoying  modifier state
             mismatch  problem  on  windows - reproduce  by  pressing  control
             right-click  on title bar to get the system menu and then release
             the  control,  ME misses  the  C-drop  event so thinks  its still
             pressed.

    [051220] JST extensions.

    [051219] JST. Added implementation of TOC to html export.

    [051219] ClearCase.  Disable check out of parent dir for cc-add as its not
             implemented

    [051215] JST.  Changed  tag   highlighting   to  handle  split  line  tags
             correctly.  Implemented  support for f and b color export to HTML
             using style.

    [051215] First commit of new v4 JST format hook and export macros.

    [051215] Fixed  the  return  value of  transpose-lines  command  which was
             always returning false causing cc-add to fail.

    [051212] SQL Template. Missing hilight  statement causes execution to fail
             - Thanks to Th.

    [051212] Fixes to old JST before it gets trashed

    [051125] Fixed regex bug where "[\\s]" incorrectly matches an 's'

    [051125] ClearCase. Added support for not loaded to cc-state

    [051123] Added support for alias-paths.

    [051122] Fixed  highlight  problems with "^ *$" & "^\\\\s*$" close bracket
             tags,   they   should    match   any   line    containing    only
             spaces/white-spaces but they did not work reliably.

    [051122] ClearCase.  Fixed the cc-diff,  external  diff  settings  had got
             muddled.

    [051122] Directory  listing.  Changed  the size  ordering to list  largest
             first on initial sort.

    [051118] ClearCase.  Implemented the auto get checkout comment and removed
             the temp command-line buffer.

    [051118] Directory  listing  window.  Added  binding  of 'f' to toggle the
             filter and changed the 's' and 'S' bindings  round (s is far more
             useful)

    [051118] Improved the horizontal scrolling of gdiff and browse

    [051110] Make  debugger  stop at executed  !elif & !else will work for all
             macros,  may not work  when  executing  a buffer  as the line may
             start with a white space.

    [051110] Stopped osd check-box  macros from  triggering  the debugger when
             $debug is set to 1.

    [051110] Added some more key translations based on bug report by Francesco
             Abbate.

    [051104] 2nd and much  improved  version of cc-setup.  Changed to using -1
             insert-string to allow multi-line  comments. Fixed horrid problem
             with  cleartool's  handling of checking  out a file when its been
             hijacked, no command-line option to make it use the hijacked file
             me has to use  ipipe-write a send 'yes' at the prompt, but as the
             prompt is not given me must be preempt  and send them  first, one
             for each file - clear-case is pants and cleartool sucks.

    [051104] Changed  cmd-line  construction to use -1 insert-string to insert
             \\n's into the line - not really very nice.

    [051104] Fixed  meGetChar to be like  GetString in that if running a macro
             the value has not been given it goes  directly to the user rather
             than simply  failing, this improves macro  reliability  and eases
             debugging of macros.

    [051104] Multi-line shell fix. The new 0x100 flag to shell-command has one
             drawback, you cannot run commands that include newline characters
             as the cmd-line must be on the first line. But CVS and clear-case
             commit  comments are often  multi-line so this is not acceptable.
             To fix  the  problem  I have  added  a -ve  arg to  insert-string
             comment which then performs a literal  insertion, i.e. every char
             including  a \\n  char is  inserted  are  text.  This  fixes  the
             immediate  problem  but  inserting a \\n char in a line can break
             other  thing in a very  major way (like  undo) so it must be used
             with extreme care.

    [051103] ClearCase.  First rev of a CC tool  defaults  setup in  cc-setup.
             Moved  CC over to using  0x100  bit in  shell-command  to  remove
             command-line length limit.

    [051102] Moved  multiple-file  file-tool  executions over to using the new
             0x100  shell-command  flag  (first  line  of  buffer)  to  remove
             command-line  length  limit in  almost  all cases  (cmd has a 4kb
             limit)

    [051102] Introduced  a new 0x100 bit for shell  commands  which  means the
             'cmd-line'  given is a buffer  names  whose  first line holds the
             command-line to run.

    [051028] ClearCase.  Fixed  cc-diff abort when a file has no  differences.
             Added a 'delete line' function to cc-state bound to C-k.

    [051019] Visual basic highlighting - added And Or and Xor operators.

    [051013] Unix shell window,  corrected  highlighting  of backslash  escape
             character outside of a string enclosure.

    [051011] ClearCase  extensions. Added button to cc-checkin to get checkout
             comment. In  cc-state - fixed file  selection  on last empty line
             and mouse selection and added support for mouse drag selection.

    [051011] Changed  dirlist  copy/move  to preserve the original  files time
             stamp.

    [051011] Fixed windows  rename to check the to name is case  insensitively
             different.

    [051011] Implemented file time-stamp  preservation in the file-op copy and
             move.

    [051011] Improved the window-popup on windows, more likely to work but can
             still fail.

    [051011] Fixed UNIX drag-n-drop, broken by -l l:c addition.

    [051007] Integrated Ric Yeates command line "-l <line>:<col>" submission -
             thanks for the submission.

    [051007] ClearCase.  Removed VOB option from  cc-state as it didn't  work.
             Made  cc-console  read  only  and  better  integrated   including
             supporting it as a toolbar tool (like cvs-console)

    [051007] Fixed bad variable assignment in directory list macros.

    [051001] Corrected  Sun  Solaris  x86  makefile  to  use  the  Sun  Native
             compiler.

    [050930] ClearCase.   Fixed  cc-state  to  check  the  state  of  selected
             directories,  which  requires  a double  cleartool  call  (horrid
             command-line) Added support for config-spec  viewing and editing.
             Added  directory  refresh option for  checkin/out  add etc. Added
             many improvements to cc-state buffer support,  highlighting, file
             listing  style  sorting and selection  (i.e.  following are bound
             1,2,3,+,-,u,a,*)

    [050930] file-tool,  changed  the buffer  list  tool-bar  tool to keep the
             current line to the current buffer when using find-buffer etc.

    [050930] Latest Mirkwood update from Bruno.

    [050930] Fixed ftp  drag'n'drop  copy bug, the  source dir needed an file:
             prefix to remove the ftp:// of the current  buffer.  While test I
             blew away my home  directory,  nasty way to discover that ftp can
             return  ".." not  "../" and ".." is not  ignored  when  deleting!
             Fixed.

    [050929] File  listing,  stopped  copy, move etc commands  from  accepting
             '../' when its the  current  line Fixed 'v' browse  file open and
             close.

    [050928] browse, removed the delete buffer flag from browse - wrong way to
             do this.

    [050928] ClearCase,  make   cc-annotate   work  if  file  is  checked  out
             (cleartool command-line is awful, why do you have to pay money to
             use this rubbish?)

    [050928] Added wrap feature to browse mode.

    [050928] Changed  Mirkwood main OSD scheme to make current focus item more
             visible.

    [050920] Changed  the $debug  variable  to be bit based as its old  values
             just could implement the required functionality.

    [050920] Latest Mirkwood highlight scheme - added underlining for spelling
             errors

    [050920] OSD, added a comment tab to the scheme  editor and  up-graded the
             scheme selectors to use combo-boxes.

    [050920] Fixed compile error on macros caused by bad macro definition.

    [050919] Fixed 2 bugs: meRegHead's  force could be left set to 1 which has
             the side effect of C-g not hiding the active  region. Due to last
             change to command-wait  the screen is not up-dated before waiting
             for a key breaking gdiff.

    [050919] Readability update to Mirkwood highlight scheme.

    [050919] Changed  ClearCase  cc-state  to handle  file  names with '['s in
             them.

    [050915] Added Up, Down, Hide  window  and  default  open  options  to the
             file-tool  setup  gui. Added  support  for a default  open to the
             directory  listing,  pressing  return now checks for a  file-tool
             default  open  (Explorerish),  'o' for open always loads the file
             into me.

    [050915] Added  support for dbx on SunOS.  Changed the ipipe input mode to
             be toggled using f3 rather than set via f2 f3 or f4.

    [050915] zfile,  fixed  filename  ->  absolute  file name when given as an
             macro arg - should be based off current buffer's path.

    [050908] Added file-tool.

    [050908] ClearCase, fixed %diff-com  definition  problem and cc-uncheckout
             buffer  update  problem.  Fixed  cc-checkout & cc-checkin  buffer
             update problems as well.

    [050908] Improved the diff highlight, more readable and correct.

    [050908] Added new Mirkwood highlight scheme.

    [050806] Added better  support for MinGW. Fixed the console  color bug and
             most of the compiler  warnings.  Added support for the MSYS shell
             by creating a unix style  mingw.gmk  (uses rm instead of del etc)
             updating the old mingw.gmk and renamed to  mingw32.gmk  and added
             support to the unix build script.

    [050803] Fixed ne crash when an unbound  key is  pressed,  bug  introduced
             with last commits.

    [050721] Fixed  annoying  mouse refocus in osd dialog even though mouse is
             not moved - another windows nasty.

    [050720] File browser, added directory  closing binding to 'c' and '+' '-'
             windows compatible bindings.

    [050720] Pop-up menus,  shifted the context menu down one line when opened
             by a key.

    [050720] Directory  listing.  Changed  the tag file list  macro to support
             moving to the  closest  selected  so the user can see which files
             they  are  deleting!  Improved  the  file-tool  so \\H will see a
             hot-key,  '\\' chars and '"' must be quoted  (i.e. '\\\\' & '\"')
             Bound 't' to open the file  tool  menu  directly  so tools can be
             easily executed without use of the mouse.

    [050720] Source code reorganization.  Standardized the # preprocess forms,
             removed  2  uses  of  #elif  and   cplusplus   and   changed  odd
             'defined(_BSD)'  style  bracketing which the c-hash-eval does not
             handle.

    [050720] Removed  unused   functionality   from  NE.  Made  the  following
             available   as   extended   functionality:   backward-delete-tab,
             change-buffer-name,      change-file-name,     define-macro-file,
             delete-blank-lines,     delete-some-buffers,    named-buffer-mode
             save-some-buffers  save-buffers-exit-emacs  user (%),  buffer (:)
             and command (.) variables  $buffer-input  $kept-versions  $mouse*
             $pause-time $MEBACKUPPATH. Removed -c from ne's help page as this
             is not supported. Moved macro regex &xseq &xrep based  directives
             and most @ variables to extended functionality.

    [050719] Organizer  address  search broken due to recent  changes to macro
             argument  getting. Fixed by changing the numeric  argument  which
             was ambiguously defined.

    [050718] Source  code  reorganization.  Made the file hook  variables  and
             HideBuffer  function statics. Changed ne to use fixed char groups
             for isUpper etc rather than the large  look-up  tables as it does
             not have set-char-mask to configure them anyway.

    [050718] C template. Fixed and greatly  simplified the #if handling in the
             hash eval code. Added support for #undef.

    [050715] Source code  organization.  Removed  unused code when  there's no
             ipipe  support.  Hashed  out  location  functions  which are only
             required by socket or ipipe support.

    [050714] Combined cc-log and cc-annotate into a single  cc-annotate common
             with gui. Added cc-vtree and cc-explorer.

    [050714] Fixed  user-setup  setting of number of backups and Ignore  files
             settings.

    [050714] Fixed file-op copy so the source file's  attributes are preserved
             (i.e.  remains  read only  etc).  Implemented  the 4th  parameter
             (attribs) in &stat i  Implemented  a file-op  chmod using arg bit
             0x200

    [050712] Corrected NE build under Windows, console build including windows
             calls.

    [050712] Directory  listing, fixed delete copy and move prompts, flag 0x08
             got changed to 0x04 in file-op.

    [050712] Implemented a proper ClearCase context diff by recreating the old
             file from the diff and then calling a real diff program.

    [050712] Changed  the diff  hilighting  to be just one scheme as a CC diff
             could  contain  a gdiff  style  for  files  and  diff  style  for
             directories.

    [050712] Corrected NE build problem with macro debugging.

    [050711] Corrected Latex template load error in hklatex.emf (detected with
             $debug=1)

    [050710] Fixed old $debug interface, found a long forgotten mode 3 (now 4)
             which simply prints the current line without waiting, this broken
             the new mode 3.

    [050709] Removed the -d command line option - pointless.

    [050709] Improved  the macro  command  argument  handling  to get  missing
             arguments  from the user, i.e. having a macro line of:  fine-file
             Works okay.

    [050709] Vastly improved the macro debugging, the $debug value of 1 is now
             2, 2 -> 3, a value  of 1 now  tells  the  user of any  un-handled
             failures.

    [050709] Fixed  the  Windows  window  resizing  behavior  to be a lot more
             usable. The window size now  increases  in  character  size steps
             rather  than  bouncing  around  and the  window is refresh as its
             changed. The Horizontal width limit of the window has effectively
             been removed (set to 400 chars) the depth is still  restricted to
             the screen size, issue raised by Tom Hundt.

    [050709] Added new file tools interface,  creating  windows  explorer type
             file name based tools (e.g. extracting a zip file).

    [050709] Added  ClearCase   cc-log  and  cc-annotate   (similar  to  cvs's
             commands)

    [050709] Stopped the default file hook from creating a bogus tool menu and
             help page.

    [050709] Fixed the previous-line macro and the kill-word key bindings.

    [050709] Changed the menu items which open a sub dialog to having '...' in
             their name as per the GUI standard, issue raised by Tom Hundt.

    [050708] Changed  sub-menu display chars, auto open menus are now ' >' and
             manual are ' +', issue raised by Tom Hundt.

    [050708] Got  thoroughly fed up with the emacs style  kill-word - useless.
             Came up with a  compromise,  if no  numeric  arg is given then it
             works  the old way, if an  argument  is given  (i.e. 1, 2 ...) it
             works in like emacs  (which  makes  sense as you are asking it to
             kill 1 word etc.)

    [050708] Changed  list-commands  and  command-apropros  to not list hidden
             macros  by  default.  They can be listed if bit 1 of the  numeric
             argument is clear (aka. list-buffers)

    [050625] Updated mode line letter  mnemonics which were out of date, issue
             raised by Tom Hundt.

    [050625] Stop me crashing when  describe-variable  is given something like
             "&or", now restricted to variables of type #, $, %, :, . only.

    [050618] Added  support for -ve offsets to &lef &mid &rig  functions to go
             from the end of the string.

    [050618] Created a 'no wait' option to  shell-command  so processes can be
             launched  and  forgotten  about. Also added  support  for all the
             other  process  launch  flags  present  in pipe and  ipipe  shell
             commands. Removed some very dead code.

    [050618] Avoided  a '&mid  -1' in  display  matching  fence  (dmf.emf)  by
             restructuring the logic a bit.

    [050616] Revision 3 of ClearCase support.

    [050614] Second rev of clear-case  support.  restructured the execution of
             cleartool  so ipipes  are used (even  though  the user may not be
             able to edit) giving  feedback on progress.  Implemented  a basic
             diff  which  can only  diff one file at a time and only  with its
             predecessor but at least it supports a context output of sorts!

    [050614] Fixed command-wait when no arg is given to return when a callback
             sets the .wait variable.  Command now returns  immediately if the
             .wait variable is not defined. Fixed windows sleep function which
             was managing to break out before it should.

    [050612] latex added macros for bold/italic/mono character formatting.

    [050612] nroff region support for character formating.

    [050612] .fhook-xxx.command-n  syntax  added to  buffer-init  to  simplify
             comamnd definition.

    [050610] Removed  "C-c C-g" key  binding in document  macros and  replaced
             with "C-c <" because of C-g issue.

    [050610] CVS added support for a cvsco.etf checkin template.

    [050610] First  revision  of  ClearCase   support,  very   incomplete  and
             primitive but the hooks required in the rest of the system are in
             place.

    [050609] Changed the directory  listing so '.' is removed and .. is always
             the first  'file' and cannot be  selected.  Fixed some  directory
             display annoying refresh issues.

    [050609] First  implementation of directory  deletion, copying and moving,
             including  support for ftp directories  etc. Areas of concern are
             still copied file's permissions and to a lesser degree ownership.
             Also the copies behavior with symbolic links, this must be tested
             further.

    [050609] Fixed file permissions and ftp minor issues a couple of major ftp
             bugs and $file-names working for ftp directories.

    [050609] Added new &stat "i" flag and  argument  bit 4 to file-op to abort
             on a problem rather than prompt, it also returns an error code in
             $result.

    [050609] Changed  the kill word  commands  so have the same word  boundary
             behaviors as  forward-word  and Emacs (was killing word only then
             white  spaces  only etc).  Corrected  word  movement  and killing
             command's EOB and BOB error handling.

    [050608] Added new rdiff (recursive diff) command

    [050608] Updated  string-rectangle  and  space-rectangle  to  improve  its
             usability.

    [050608] Updated describe-word setup comment.

    [050601] Corrected ne.emf, broke Window mode in disabling console mode for
             ne -R option change.

    [050601] Corrected  crash  on  highlight  with   alpha-numerics   of  form
             [[:digit:]] when spelt incorrectly.

8th Release - May 2005

  Upgrade Notes

    * Users upgrading from previous releases (including 2005.02 RC1) should be
      aware that the  search/replace  syntax has changed the syntax of \s? and
      \S? in favor of Perl's simpler \s and \S for a whitespace char class and
      should  upgrade  any user  defined  macros.  Very  simply the syntax has
      changed from \sspace to \s and \Sspace to \S. The only nasty side effect
      is hilight's  miss-use of \S1-\S9 to mean not \1-\9 group char,  changed
      to \!1-\!9.

    * New character classes exist for \d = digits, \D != digits \h = hexdigits
      \H != hexdigits \l = lowercase \L != lowercase \u = uppercase  and \U !=
      uppercase.  Added  support for character  classes  within the main regex
      [...]  character  class, i.e. now  supports  regexs like [\l\u_] for any
      lower,  upper or '_' char. This is not  supported  in the hilight  which
      currently has a more simplistic [...] character class support.

    * Regular  expressions - extended the  replacement  string  syntax.  Added
      support for \c#, \l# and \u# to change the case of groups,  where \c# is
      capitalise,  \l# is lowercase \u# is uppercase and # is the group number
      (0-9, &)

    * Users upgrading from releases prior to RC1 (2005.02) should delete their
      user.erf  file and configure as a new user to ensure that the mode flags
      are correct.

    * ne is now set to not auto-save or create backups by default.  Options -a
      and -B enable and disable auto-save and backup modes.

    * ne now  supports a new command  line option -R which  reverses the video
      (also  supported in a DOS/Windows  console) i.e. provides black on white
      in a black console.

  History

    [050530] Debian package support added to CD distribution.

    [050525] Re-released 20050505 source + Fedora + 2.6 + CD distribution.

    [050524] Linux  2.6  changed  to   libncurses   by  default   rather  than
             libtermcap.  Would  appear  that  some  Linux  distributions  are
             dropping libtermcap installation.

    [050522] Re-released 20050505 source + CD distribution.

    [050522] NE build correction for osd bug, conditional compilation required
             to for mouse only code.

    [050518] Re-released 20050505 Windows builds

    [050518] Fixed  windows  osd bug which break the main menus undo  feature,
             extra  mouse-move keys generated  during OSD interaction  trashes
             the @cl (last  command)  value so the menu undo only ever  undoes
             the last. (Reported post release)

    [050508] JASSPA  MicroEmacs  8th release - final. Core and macro  versions
             20050505.

    [050514] Fixed ftp copy lock-up (most  noticable on windows) caused by the
             response  read  at the  start  of a  command  also  reading  (and
             disgarding)  the finishing  message so ME hangs at the end of the
             command waiting for a response.

    [050514] Enabled ipipes under cygwin by default.

    [050514] Fixed win32s build.

    [050514] Fixed mecygwin interactive MS-DOS and cygwin BASH shells.

    [050513] Found the UNIX  waitpid(-1,...)  in the sigchild  handler  (which
             removes any zoombie  processes) removes the pipe commands process
             so the pclose call cannot get the  process's  exit code  (returns
             -1).

    [050509] Changed  the name of aix43  make  files to aix4 and sunos 55 & 56
             files to a single sunos5 makefile

    [050509] Added support for aix v5 (tested on aix v5.1)

    [050507] Added Finnish support to ne.emf.

    [050506] Improved python collapse and item-list  support and added eaf and
             etf for python - thanks to Detlef.

    [050505] Base version numbers reset for next release.

    [050429] Added  support for  key-binding  to  item-list  column  ordering,
             function  is  item-list-order  and  is  bound  to 1, 2  and  3 by
             default.  Thanks to Bryan  Schofield  for his  submission in this
             area.

    [050429] Spelling - protect '.'s in the word with \\.

    [050428] Corrected  TCL  highlighting  w.r.t.  comment  at  end of  line -
             submitted by Bryan Schofield.

    [050427] Major  reworking of main commands in a directory  listing buffer.
             Implemented typical features found in an OFM standard browser and
             create  standard  bindings  as  well as  termcap  friendly  ones.
             Changed  delete binding to delete files rather than close browser
             which is now bound to f10.

    [050427] osd - Added  numeric bit 8 on osd-entry arg to put the text above
             the entry.

    [050427] Added C-x k support  to  browser  mode to kill the  buffer,  also
             added hook for the file-browser's view file.

    [050427] Fixed  user-setup  to  use  only  one  value  of  $file-ignore  &
             $kept-versions  per  platform  rather than one for window and one
             for console based versions.

    [050427] Shrunk the size of the file-attrib  dialog to ensure it fits on a
             termcap screen.

    [050427] Fixed  nasty  bug with  transpose-line  at the end of the  buffer
             swapping the last line with the first!

    [050427] main.c - Fixed minor compiler warnings.

    [050426] Added a binding for file completion (any key bound to insert-tab)
             so OSD dialogs can do completion (although awkwardly).

    [050423] Fixed  wiki  edit mode for  Russian  keyboards,  the 'k' flag key
             mapping was breaking things.

    [050423] Windows - Fixed  windows  Ctrl numeric pad keys, now come through
             as C-0 ... C-9 C-* C-+ etc.

    [050420] Added new  Dot/Neato  support  fhook (for .dot files) - thanks to
             Detlef for the submission.

    [050420] TCL - Added more hilight tokens from Detlef.

    [050420] Document  macros - fixed  cpp->tcl  typo - thanks  to Detlef  for
             spotting this.

    [050410] Fixed the -R option for DOS box,  cursor  same as the  foreground
             color which is not ideal!

    [050410] Fixed the SunOS x86 makefile to disabled  #pragam  warnings under
             GCC.

    [050409] Release Candidate 2 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC2)

    [050408] Added flag to the user-setup  Tools to force the rereading of the
             current buffer's file, thanks to Bryan Schofield.

    [050408] Added new .item-list.width  variable to allow control of the item
             window list - submitted by Bryan Schofield.

    [050408] Moved the  generate  tags into the sub folder and added a compile
             option to c and cpp - submitted by Bryan Schofield.

    [050405] Added  support  for  DOS  code  page  866  (Cyrillic  Russian)  -
             submitted by Nicholas Kudriavtsev

    [050331] Added support for the setting of the history in macros via @h#.

    [050325] registry.c - removed compiler warning  indicating porting problem
             highlighted  under Darwin. Post  increment of variable on left of
             assignment and same variable appeared on the right, split out the
             increment to reduce ambiguity of the statement.

    [050320] UNIX only - add a rule for .dir files found in the X11 directory.
             We do not want this files identified as "dir" info root file

    [050320] Added termcap (white) scheme for reverse video operation.

    [050320] Newuser  registry  file -  added  default  entry  for  Apple  Mac
             "darwin". Confirmed operation under Mac X-Windows.

    [050320] Extended ME exit  commands to support the  discarding of modified
             buffers '0x8 discard modified buffers' and '0x10 discard modified
             buffers and create recovery file for changes'.

    [050320] Corrected  XML  syntax  for  strings  "..."  to  fix  indent  and
             highlight anomalies.

    [050319] Added -R  command  line  option  to  reverse  the  built in video
             schemes - specifically for ne(1) also works with me(1).

    [050319] Corrected  default mode settings.  Recent  removal of letter(2m),
             line(2m) etc. changed the mode byte assignment of some modes. The
             built in global  mode  default was not updated for this change in
             bytes  and  incorrect   global  modes  appeared  as  a  result  -
             specifically quiet(2m) which has jumped bytes.

    [050315] LEX/YACC template - Corrected LEX and YACC highlighting.  Aligned
             C, C++ and YACC/LEX templates to be consistent.

    [050315] C/C++  templates - buffer  setup  modified  for GNU Indent  Style
             setting.

    [050315] Added new browse(3)  command and binding to f3, changed  existing
             collapse-all f3 binding to C-f2.

    [050315] Modified  ME exit  commands to support a bitwise arg n where main
             exit-emacs  has '0x01  Prompt',  '0x02  Save each  buffer/reg/dic
             (with  prompt if 0x01  set)' and '0x04  Prompt  for exit code and
             exit ME with that code.'

    [050313] Latex  template -  Corrected  the  latex-fill-paragraph.  Set the
             fill-mode  to 'l'  rather  than 'L'  because  its a pain  when it
             selects center rather than left and messes things up.

    [050311] Directory  list - changed  column  sorting so  Modified is sorted
             most recent first.

    [050311] Fixed perldb pipe operation.

    [050310] OSD  simplified the main context menu and moved paste a CVS items
             in the directory context menu

    [050310] Fixed diff's file name input, was not completing correctly

    [050310] CVS changed the default setting of the recursive add to off.

    [050310] JASSPA MicroEmacs quick start document released.

    [050309] Fixed bug in regex  multi-line  search  backwards,  searching for
             "foo[^a]" is a mult-line as [^a] matches \\n, if "foob" exists at
             the start of the line isearch-backward refuses to move on.

    [050309] Catman pages added for ne(1) and me(1)  complaints with Gentoo as
             missing. Added to the package builds.

    [050308] Fixed a nasty  bug with ftp  connect  dialog  when the host has a
             port. Changed the default path to be nothing which becomes /~/ to
             list the login directory. Change the tab order to not include the
             password  as tabbing  through  the entry will lose the  password,
             must now access via mouse or hot key which is not ideal.

    [050308] Added  support for relative ftp browsing via new  ftp://???/~/???
             url form. Added file name completion support for ftp

    [050306] Corrected the docmacro http:// ling regular expression.

    [050306] Changed the date format of the -V command  line option to include
             the century, same format as the about(2) buffer.

    [050302] HTLP and PHP - fixed indent problems.

    [050302] Perl template - fixed indent  problems caused by not skipping the
             =~ type regex's

    [050302] TCL template - fixed continuation and comment indent bug.

    [050302] Added support for R/S-plus (.r) files - thanks to Detlef.

    [050225] HTML  template  - fixed an  indent  which was fixed at "2" rather
             than "t" and added comment skipping indent rules

    [050225] dos2unix, unix2dos and unix2win - Removed use of &spr in favor of
             &cat so dos2unix etc work in ne.

    [050225] Tracing a problem with  highlighting  a token of the form "AB*$",
             works if there is a B but  fails if there  are no 'B's, i.e. only
             matches  "AB+$". Found that removing the end of line special case
             code fixes the  problem. I believe  the rest of the code has been
             improved to handle any end-of-line quirks - I hope so!

    [050225] Removed  the  'start-up'  macro  function  compile  option so all
             versions support this - "ne" can now do a "@dos2unix"

    [050225] Regular  expressions - extended  replacement string syntax. Added
             support  for "\c#" "\l#" and "\u#" to change  the case of groups,
             where "\c#" is capitalize,  "\l#" is lower "\u#" is upper and "#"
             is the group number (0-9, &)

    [050225] Regular  expressions - changed syntax of "\s?" and "\S?" in favor
             of perl's  simpler  "\s" and "\S" for a  whitespace  char  class.
             Added new character  classes "\d" = digits, "\D" != digits "\h" =
             hex-digits  "\H" != hex-digits "\l" = lowercase "\L" != lowercase
             "\u" = uppercase  and "\U" != uppercase.  These changes were made
             to both the main regex  search  engine and the  hilight(2)  token
             matching  engine. Added support for char classes  within the main
             regex  [...]  character  class,  i.e. now  supports  regexs  like
             "[\l\u_]" for any lower, upper or '_' char. This is not supported
             in the hilight which currently has a more simplistic "[...]" char
             class support.

    [050225] Regular  expressions  -  changed  use of "\s ", "\s-",  "\S " and
             "\S-"  classes  to  simply  "\s"  and "\S"  which  is perl  regex
             compliant (ditching Emacs "\s" syntax as it is cumbersome and not
             very useful). The only nasty side effect is hilight's miss-use of
             "\S1" - "\S9" to mean  not "\1" - "\9"  group  char,  changed  to
             "\!1" - "\!9"

    [050224] NE set to not auto-save or create backups by default.

    [050224] Added "-a" and "-B"  command  line  options to enable and disable
             auto-save and backup modes.

    [050224] Tcl template - some more fixes to the item list from Detlef

    [050224] watch -  improved  the  refresh  rate  of a type 2 or 3 watch  by
             ignoring the :watch time and just look at the :watch-size.  Fixed
             the split  line  issue  with type 2 of 3 watching  caused by last
             line not being complete.

    [050224] M-x ftp - stripped  'ftp://'  and any  trailing  '/' of the users
             entered  host name as these  break  ftp.  Improved  the  dialog's
             handling of  passwords,  the user can now tell if a password  has
             been set.

    [050224] Added standard binding for mark-function

    [050224] Fixed the ME token highlighting in the C hook

    [050224] Removed  recently  added  %no_backup  variable to disable  backup
             create as new -B option is a much better way of doing it.

    [050224] edef.h - Removed definition of nonexistent variable

    [050224] Fixed failure when trying to load "http://www.jasspa.com",  there
             is an implicit trailing '/' which MicroEmacs now adds.

    [050224] Tcl template - major improvement - courtesy of Detlef.

    [050224] Fixed  collapse to support the file hooks .exact  setting (set to
             -1 means case insensitive)

    [050224] Added      new      beginning-of-function,       end-of-function,
             goto-function-line and mark-function macros - thanks to Detlef.

    [050223] Windows  MS-dev  6  project  -  corrected  project  settings  for
             _URLSUPP => _SOCKET in keeping  with the socket  dynamic  library
             loading.

    [050223] Added exec of wish to the tcl magic hook

    [050223] Fixed $window-chars - added OSD default button chars.

    [050222] Fixed $user-path being more that 35 chars breaking the user-setup
             dialog.

    [050222] Directory listing - call fhook-html when file is a http:// file -
             this is never a directory listing.

    [050222] Stopped  loading of files in dir listing when clicking way to the
             right,  must click on the name (ME kept  loading  files when just
             trying to raise the window to the front - annoying).

    [050222] If 0 given  to watch  call  watch-time,  this  preserves  the old
             interface.

    [050222] Added backup file  disabling  for  "dos2unix"  macros via command
             line definable variable.

    [050221] Changed the new Windows process tree killing to use LoadLibrary()
             to detect whether the OS supports this feature (and NT does not).
             Also moved the URL support over to LoadLibrary() so we can remove
             the -u builds.

    [050220] Added UNIX Shell and Makefile highlighting to notes(2).

    [050219] Fixed GNU GCC  warnings  in  Makefiles  for  #pragma in X11 files
             under Sun Solaris and uninitialized variables.

    [050219] OSD. Removed  dialog 'F' flag as it was not  documented,  did not
             work and only used in one obscure  place. Fixed C-g & Del so they
             close up to the previous dialog but does close the main menu down
             in one call - was annoying.

    [050219] Release Candidate 1 - MicroEmacs 2005 (RC1)

    [050218] Corrected  UNIX  client-server  socket  file check -- bad test on
             existence of  connection  file, using wrong  variable  with wrong
             test sense.

    [050218] Added site delete button to ftp-connect dialog.

    [050218] Fixed abbreviation and exec-string "\\p" and "\\P" store and goto
             position  problem  when  the C-x C-a or C-x a keys  are  rebound.
             Fixed by replacing with 'esc x set-alpha-mark  P' (where esc x is
             a safe internal special key).

    [050218] Updated watch  interface and made public.  Created new watch-time
             command and prompt user for watch type when no argument is given.

    [050218] Removed the use of bit 0x1000 in ada string  highlight as this is
             unlikely to be wanted (probably copied from Pascal).

    [050218] Changed the registry  parser to abort on error rather than trying
             to carry on (a very  painful  process for a badly  decrypted  reg
             file)

    [050218] Fixed  highlighting minor issues. Hilight scheme now returns back
             to EOL  scheme  after a  bracket.  A  branch  tag on an EOL  line
             removes the EOL flag so it highlights  correctly.  Branch tag now
             supports the 0x1000 single line highlight. Look back now supports
             0x800 on a branch tag.

    [050217] HTML  highlighting.  Fixed some really grizzly scripted HTML page
             highlighting issues, predominantly with php.

    [050217] Change  ftp so it opens  the  ftp-connect  dialog if the  current
             buffer is *ftp-files*.

    [050217] Fixed ftp dir list column  detection and highlighting  issue with
             windows ftp servers (time given as 9:15 not 09:15)

    [050217] Fixed bug in set-variable and unset-variable when &spr is used to
             create a variable name.

    [050217] Watch command  (watch.emf).  Improved the watch  command, made '0
             watch' call watch-reset,  changed watch-reset so with an argument
             of 0 it removes  all watches  otherwise  it resets the main watch
             counter and reports to the user which buffers are watched.  Added
             new '2 watch' & '3 watch' which compares the file size, doing the
             following:

                * file on disk is smaller than last watch - reloads whole file
                * file size is the same - does nothing
                * file on disk is  larger - appends  to the end of the  buffer
                  the tail of the file (file_size - watch_file_size bytes)

             This assumes that the files is always being appended  (reasonable
             assumption in most cases. The only difference  between 2 and 3 is
             that 2 forces a  complete  reread  of the file on the first  file
             change  (ensuring the buffer is correct), 3 does not which allows
             the  user to  trash  the  first  gigabyte  of the  buffer  before
             starting the watch.

    [050217] Shell  template - added local and  function  keywords and fixed a
             few string highlighting problems.

    [050216] Made  the  dir-listing's  (Filtered)  label  on line 2  pickable,
             changing the filter status when picked Made CVS's CVS-Quick label
             pickable doing a full reread when picked.

    [050216] Fixed a  couple  of silly  register  bugs  introduced  with  last
             find-reg  concatenate root and sub-key change. Improved  behavior
             when ftp erf file is missing,  now create a new one in memory and
             flags as changed so should be saved on exit.

    [050216] Do not abort me.emf execution if ftp erf file is missing or bad.

    [050216] Fixed by removing the 'startup'  function, the main init now uses
             dofile  directly  and it  checks  for  either  a NULL  or "" as a
             filname and replaces with "me" or ("ne" and does not complain) if
             found to be empty.  This  means that give  execute-file  an empty
             string  executes  either "me" or "ne", i.e. resets me - nice side
             effect. Changed  'dofile()' to execFile() and changed  execFile()
             to executeFile()  (as is function for command  execute-file)  and
             change the other exec command function names for consistency.

    [050216] Fixed an  annoyance  reported by Bruno, ne should not complain if
             it fails to find ne.emf - fair enough.

    [050215] Fixed  crash  caused  by using -c option  with all  files  hidden
             (comment  when  browsing  ftp dirs as cache dir lists are hidden)
             The startup  process  knows the history  created  buffers but the
             replacement  was none of these and due to the  tool-bar  it was a
             buffer without a file name and bang! Fixed in 2 ways, first check
             the  replacement  has a file name, second do not put hidden files
             into the history - they're hidden.

    [050210] Improved  movement  between  items using the cursor in the search
             dialog.

    [050210] Fixed CVS dialog default settings

    [050210] Corrected search path expansion, incorrectly handling a PATH_CHAR
             at the start of the string.

    [050209] Up-dated  user-setup  platform  page to new style and added  yank
             rectangle binding.

    [050209] Fixed no-color termcap $window-char variable setting

    [050209] Fixed hot keys (were 3 'U's) in osdmisc.emf

    [050209] Added  new   BraceStatement   indent   value  to  support  GNU  C
             indentation style.

    [050209] Fixed the osdDisp()  function  required a TTflush  otherwise  the
             cursor is left in the wrong position on termcap systems.

    [050209] Fixed the default $window-char variable setting.

    [050209] Fixed the DOS home directory setting and compiler warnings.

    [050208] Changed  the C indent  definition  to be the same  format  as the
             existing indent  definitions  i.e. uses flag & indent value, this
             makes it more flexible and extendible. Updated macro files.

    [050205] Password generation macros added to contrib directory.

    [050205] Added  JavaDoc   highlighting   to  Java  template.   Enable  via
             buffer-setup. Removed the existing "my" extensions from contrib.

    [050205] Added  Doxygen,  <stdint.h>  and  error   highlighting  to  C/C++
             templates. Enablement via buffer-setup. Removed the existing "my"
             extensions from contrib.

    [050204] osd - Fixed problems with the 'cursor shows current item' feature
             of osd caused by the cursor position going outside of the window.

    [050202] Added an initial item number to the favorite and buffer menus.

    [050203] Standardized  narrow anchor and line flag movement behaviors with
             respect to deleting and inserting  text. Enforced to  effectively
             exist at character column -1 and been strict about  maintaining a
             protected  line. Made undo cope with markup  lines that are lost.
             These changes may be a little to severe - we'll see.

    [050202] Fixed C-g close osd dialog crash.

    [050202] Directory  listing  - fixed  nasty  bug  cause  by the  directory
             changing  on disk  before  the hook has  managed  to do  anything
             leading to a failure - this has been annoying Jon for some time!

    [050127] hkemf.emf - Fixed !until indent rule

    [050127] First revision of "notes".

    [050127] Fixed positional  problems with mouse rectangle regions and added
             a mouse rectangle yank to user-setup.

    [050127] CVS - Set the initial osd dialog item to be the first item rather
             than the Okay button (with is still the default button).

    [050127] Fixed *scratch* hook  assignment  issues, initial  startup buffer
             and only buffer delete problem.

    [050127] Added process tree killing for windows, tested on win98, 2k & XP,
             would be good to test on win95  (which  should work) and NT which
             should  not  work but  hopefully  will be no worse  than  current
             version.

             This is a process  tree killing for ipipes, in win32  killing the
             process we create is simply not good enough, all child  processes
             continue unaffected. For example, run compile, kill the buffer in
             mid compile and it carries on behind your back!

             For  Unix we use a new  group  and kill the  group,  DOS does not
             support  ipipe. We could have used the new Job  concept in ME but
             this  is  only  present  in  win2000  & XP and the  binaries  are
             unlikely  to run on win98  etc. This  should  run on every  win32
             platform although it is unlikely to do anything positive on an NT
             box (works in win2k)

    [050126] Changed  the  location  of the  fhook-default  macro  so its only
             defined if using buffinit (i.e. if running main me.emf)

    [050126] Fixed osd button repeat issue when current focus is an entry.

    [050126] Changed  "insert-file-name" to insert buffer name if a -ve arg is
             given, bound to C-x y, this replaces ml-lines esc y feature.

    [050123] Fixed a crash  caused by too many  closed  fences, the  recursive
             nature of the  findfence()  function  triggers  a stack  crash at
             around 22000 on windows. Set limit to 256 nested fences.

    [050122] Fixed  "dir"  mode loss on a  directory  re-read,  this  caused a
             number of side effects  including loss of  highlighting  and user
             prompt to reload the directory when it had changed.

    [050119] Removed the "sub-key"  argument  from all registry  related calls
             ("&reg" and  "set-registry"). The registry calls used to comprise
             two  arguments  "root" and  "sub-key",  the  "sub-key"  is really
             redundant  and the same effect may be achieved by a simple string
             concatenation of the "sub-key" to the "root".

    [050119] Added "my-*hook-always" macro checks in the buffer hook switching
             to permit  global  file hooks to be defined,  this  allows a file
             hook to operate on all  buffers.  "my-*hook-always"  is  executed
             after the language file hooks of "*hook-XXX" and "my-*hook-XXX".

    [050116] Added "TODO" highlighting rule for Makefile comments.

    [050114] Fixed narrow(2) type numeric argument not processed correctly.

    [050113] Added tool-bar tool mouse select region command.

    [050113] Added bindings for the CVS and ftp console tools.

    [050113] Fixed organizer(3) duplicate index bug.

    [050111] Deleted the  get-registry(2)  command, this has been  depreciated
             and &reg should be used instead.

    [050111] Extended the  read-registry(2)  and save-registry(2)  commands to
             permit  reading and writing from a buffer based registry  (rather
             than file).

    [050111] Extended  list-registry(2)  to permit listing of specific  nodes,
             the output buffer of the registry listing may be specified. Added
             a  invisible  flag  to a  registry  node  which  hides  the  node
             completely (but can be toggled).

    [050111] Fixed windows  server cmd file polling of up to 60 times a second
             by making the adder of the command responsible for 'waking' ME by
             sending a WM_USER  message.  This is not a problem for UNIX as it
             is possible to wait on file input and EOF is not reported.

    [050105] Fixed several  narrow-to  usability  issues, with these fixes the
             top and bottom narrow cannot be removed without a markup line and
             the order cannot get muddled.

    [050105] Fixed a problem with the anchor position up-date when inserting a
             whole line.

    [050105] Changed  the osd entry  mouse  handling to always  refocus,  this
             allows the user to change location in the current entry using the
             mouse.

    [050105] Fixed. insert-macro undo location was incorrect causing a crash.

    [050103] Spelling  dialog.  Changed the Ignore  button to Continue if word
             becomes   correct  without   changing  (word  added  or  language
             changed).

    [050103] Fixed. CVS osd dialog with bad hot-key.

    [050102] Added setting of $recent-keys variable.

    [041231] Variable    "$fmatchdelay"    renamed   to   "$pause-time".   The
             "$pause-time" is now used for other  MicroEmacs  delay times when
             the user is prompted for information.

    [041224] Fixed several usability issues in the search replace dialog.

    [041224] Up-graded printer-setup dialog to new style OSD.

    [041224] CVS dialog - added read-only option to checkout and update.

    [041224] Fixed goto-line offset which as always going to the previous line
             (one out).

    [041221] Added  support  for proper kill buffer use in message  line, i.e.
             set-mark,  kill-region,  copy-region, yank and reyank all work in
             the same way as a normal buffer.

    [041221] Fixed registry node deletion when the node is modified.

    [041221] Removed osd 0 'd' flag and added 'I' initial item and 'D' default
             button  flags,  existing  osd dialogs  which use 'd' will fail to
             load and need are migrated to use the D and I flags.

    [041218] auto-spell  key  bindings  are  promoted to global so its easy to
             enable in any buffer.

    [041218] Corrected  setting of the $home  environment  variable  to handle
             MS-Windows '\\'s, auto terminate with '/'.

    [041210] Added Enable/Disable Auto-Spell to the context menu.

    [041210] Rearranged the organizer dialog to be a little easier to navigate
             through.

    [041210] Fixed nedit emulation insert binding.

    [041210] Removed "ml-clear" command, replaced with "0 ml-write".

    [041210] Removed the  change-directory  commands, a change in directory is
             achieved by changing the "$buffer-fname" value such that the path
             defines the location of the command. All macros operated relative
             to the buffer location and never explicitly changed the directory
             location.

    [041210] Fixed CUA emulation insert binding.

    [041210] Deleted   letter(2m)   mode.   Use   the   default   binding   of
             "forward-delete-char"  for letter mode off, where single  deleted
             characters  are to be added to the kill buffer then the  existing
             letter(2m)    mode   may   be   achieved   by   binding   as   "1
             forward-delete-char".        Similarly       for       backspace,
             "backward-delete-char".

    [041210] Deleted  line(2m)  mode. Use a binding of "1 kill-line"  to mimic
             the  line(2m)  mode  enabled and  "kill-line"  for line(2m)  mode
             disabled.

    [041210] Deleted cmode(2m). Electric-c is now configured with indent(2). C
             and C++ indent  styles  can be  different,  can also have a GNU C
             style  etc, can  change  the  indent  width  as new  indent  rule
             supports 't', consistent $buffer-indent interface.

    [041210] Created new osd file  "osdmisc.emf" for miscellaneous OSD macros,
             this removes the OSD  dependency  when the MicroEmacs is executed
             in special  start up modes with  startup  files. Moved search and
             new  indent-setup  commands out of "search.emf"  and "format.emf"
             into a new  "osdmisc.emf"  as they cause problems with utils that
             do not run "me.emf" (e.g. "ehftools.emf")

    [041210] Introduced  a  GNU  emacs   emulation  mode,  emulation  file  is
             "meemacs.emf".

    [041209] Fixed newuser  "$user-name.emf"  conflict  issue with an existing
             macro (e.g.  zaurus.emf)  by testing for it and prefixing a digit
             to make the file unique.

    [041209] Added esc C-\\ binding to restyle-buffer.

    [041209] Fixed some issues with the Tools user-setup dialog.

    [041128] Added MinGW  makefile  posted to JASSPA  group, forms part of the
             release makefiles.

    [041126] Added  'k'  keyboard  setup  to  set-char-mask  which  is used to
             translates foreign keys to a Latin char.

    [041126] Changed  the  internal  LEADER  byte  to  0x1c as 0xff is a valid
             Russian char and it badly breaks $vars and macros.

    [041126] Fixed spell dump word which was not  translating the words to the
             users char-set.

    [041126] Added support for Russian language.

    [041126] Improved  the  aff  ispell  conversion   routines  (almost  works
             automatically).

    [041126] Stopped  auto-spell  from  triggering the no dictionaries  error,
             leave it to spell-buffer etc.

    [041125] Fixed OSD  multi-line C-k kill-line  behavior and  implemented -1
             kill-line support.

    [041125] Added basic support for Verilog programming language.

    [041123] Fixed ftp OSD (auto  entering  entries broke the password  field)
             and modernized.

    [041028] Fixed. *find* buffer exhibits the same behavior as *grep* buffer.
             i.e. the *find* buffer  remains on screen and a pop-up  window is
             used to show the file.

    [041028] Fixed.  *grep*  buffer  does not load  file  when  selected  with
             <RETURN>.

    [041027] Spruced  up old  "apache.conf"  highlighting  rules  and added to
             release.

    [041022] Fixed very obscure CVS load-up bug.

    [041122] Updated  schemes to set 'Show cursor in osd' suitably and to make
             sure the cursor is not red as this conflicts with the match fence
             display.

    [041120] Fixed transpose-line crash when undo mode is disabled.

    [041120] Removed  the  OSD  explicit  tab  order  value  as  this  was not
             constructively used and causes many item order problems.

    [041119] Many   improvements  to  OSD  dialog  user  interface   following
             suggestions  for news group.  Updated  most of the osd dialogs to
             use the new [*] check-box  chars. Fixed tabbing  orders and moved
             some  items  over to  combo-boxes.  Added  osd-cursor  visibility
             support to  scheme-edit.  Made the displaying of the cursor in an
             osd dialog a $system bit set by the hilight  scheme and fixed the
             position when in a child dialog.

    [041118] Added a macro  recursion depth limit of 20 to avoid blowing up ME
             when the user has created an infinitely recursive macro.

    [041112] Added Paul Boekholt's suggested GNU Emacs key bindings.

    [041107] kill-paragraph,     fill-paragraph,     forward-paragraph     and
             backward-paragraph  commands redefined.  kill-paragraph now kills
             forward  and  backward  rather  than  control  the  kill  buffer.
             Paragraph  movement now defined  blank-line to blank-line  rather
             than the first/last paragraph line.

    [041105] Fixed kill-lines and kill-word numerical argument implementation.

    [041104] Removed  "regex-forward"  and  "regex-backward"  macros and moved
             uses of them over to search-buffer.

    [041104] Added  "search-buffer"  command which replaces the macro commands
             "regex-forward" and "regex-backward". Simplifies macro processing
             of  searching  by  providing  a search that  explicitly  sets the
             "exact"  and  "magic"  modes. The  default is to respect  buffers
             exact and magic  mode and flags  must have E or M to ensure  they
             are disabled.

    [041104] Changed any use of  "kill-line"  to "1 kill-line"  as this should
             maintain  its  required  behavior. A "kill-line"  with no numeric
             argument  kills  to the end of the line but  excludes  the end of
             line character (GNU Emacs  compatibility). The default binding is
             the "1 kill-line" form, re-bind the key to "kill-line" if the end
             of line is not to be killed.

    [041104] Removed  line and letter  buffer modes as these can be done using
             numerical  arguments to bindings. See the the "kill-line" binding
             which   replaces   line  mode.  See   "forward-delete-char"   and
             "backward-delete-char" binding which replaces letter mode.

    [041104] Changed the "kill-word"  commands to be more  consistent with GNU
             Emacs.

    [041102] Moved winterm over to using  addKeyToBufferOnce()  for mouse move
             and  time,  also  done  same  for UNIX  mouse  time  event.  This
             minimizes  the number of mouse moved events that are processed by
             the system.

    [041101] MS Windows. Fixed mouse cursor  disappearing  after using a Shift
             or Control mouse button event.

    [041101] Auto reload the directory even if it is changed (hkdirlst.emf).

    [041030] MS-Windows. Removed the  "WM_INPUTLANGCHANGE"  message handler as
             this did the  wrong  thing  (use  Alt-Shift  to change  between 2
             different keyboards e.g. US and Russian)

    [041030] MS-Windows.  Changed  the method used to get the APPDATA  path to
             use  SHGetSpecialFolderLocation()  as  this is  available  in all
             versions of Windows.

    [041030] UNIX. Fixed the mouse movement which caused a rendering  anomaly.
             Mouse moved  commands are only added to the key buffer if the key
             is not already  present in the key queue. This alleviates a large
             build  up of  redundant  mouse  move  keys on the  queue.  (Added
             function addKeyToBufferOnce())

    [041030] Added mouse rectangle  region selection  methods,  copy-rectangle
             and kill-rectangle.

    [041029] Hardened C++ commenting on // alignment when the previous line is
             a solid ////////// when re-styling buffer.

    [041029] Fixed "*find*"  buffer  operation so that it operates like *grep*
             on file  selection.  Keyboard  file  section  enabled  within the
             "*grep*" and "*find*" buffer.

    [041029] Added Apache configuration file highlighting rules.

    [041026] Spruced up old "smb.conf"  highlighting rules, brought them up to
             date with latest keywords and added to release.

    [041026] Fixed indent-setup osd dialog.

    [041024] Macro/source  compatibility  macro and source versions updated to
             "20041001".

    [041024] Fixed the cvs-diff options, local with HEAD was not correct.

    [041024] Latex template extended. Buffer bindings for underscore and quote
             keys. Search tools to determine current context.

    [041023] Extended  the  buffer  setup for the  indent  mechanism.  May now
             specify  the  default  buffer  indent-width  and  tab-size in the
             buffer setup dialog.

    [041022] Revised  indentation  implementation.  The  templates  now define
             indent  width  independent  rules. The  indent  commend  'indent'
             parameter  may be defined as an absolute  indentation  or using a
             't'  notation.  The  syntax  is  "[-][[indent][/indent]]t"  which
             defines a vulgar  fration  of 't' which is the  indent  width (or
             tabsize) as specified by "$buffer-indent-width" defined below.

             The  global  variables  "$tabsize"  renamed  "$indent-width"  and
             controls  the  global   indentation  size.  "$tabwidth"   renamed
             "$tab-width"  and  controls  the  display  size of a literal  TAB
             character.

             The indentation is now specified on a buffer basis, the variables
             "$buffer-indent-width"   and   "$buffer-tab-width"   define   the
             indentation and TAB width on a per buffer basis. These are seeded
             from the aforementioned global variables.

    [041022] Fixed spelling mistake in user interface of XML macros.

    [041022] Removed  CVS  "Log:"  field  from  all  of the  template  files -
             undesirable.

    [041022] Added HTTP highlighting to the text document template.

    [041021] Enhanced Wiki language template.

    [041021] Added Windows CUA emulation mode.

    [041019] Fixed insert binding for Nedit emulation mode

    [041019] Fixed perl highlighting rules. Using incorrect syntax.

    [041016] Fixed UNIX make files for building NE in debug mode.

    [041016] Fixed termcap entry for ^@ key (C-space).  (Thanks to Bob Paddock
             for noting ommission)

    [041016] Added M-% binding to  query-replace  as built in binding. (Thanks
             to Bob Paddock)

    [041016] Added Ruby programming language support.

    [041015] Corrected  problem with directory  listing  loosing  highlighting
             (@mna problem).

    [041014] Within OSD, fixed spelling mistake. Loose -> Lose

    [041014] Fixed delete-hilight-lines failure when buffer file has changed.

    [041009] Fixed  osd  entry  scheme as the  cursor  was not  visible  in MS
             Dev-Studio Colors.

    [041009] Added Wiki language template

    [041003] Wheel mouse binding added as default.

    [041003] Catch long lines from cut and paste, resolve crash.

    [041002] Added X-Windows drag and drop support using xdnd.

    [040930] Added HTML, XML and SGML close bracket auto expansion.

    [040930] Added XML and HTML verification macro. Added XML utilities macros
             to allow next and  previous tag to be matched. The XML  utilities
             are also used by SGML.

    [040930] Added  xxxx-pre-expand-abbrev  hook so that  macros may add their
             own expansion methods.

    [040917] Added <...> as supported fences.

    [040917] Fixed the -1 add-next-line ignore line feature.

    [040915] cvs-add  looks for a Tags file in the CVS  directory and sets the
             GUI  state  appropriately.  Added  server to the  cvs-state  line
             mangling.

    [040909] CVS GUI updated with new features. Added repository set up to the
             UI. Reduced wait time on long commands by using ipipe. Allowed -z
             option to be used with %cvs-com.

    [040828] About page includes the century in the date (suggested by -Th)

    [040824] Fix for man page hyper-link when includes -/./_ characters.

    [040814] Linux manual page formatting fixes.

Minor Patch - July 2004

    [040728] Released patches.

    [040728] Corrected Linux kernel 2.6 pty allocation.

    [040630] Linux manual page formatting fixes.

    [040518] Comment  definition  corrections  for C, C++  and  java,  notable
             doxygen comment formation omitted.

    [040518] Corrected block comment  formatting, adding an extra space at the
             end of the comment.

7th Release - March 2004

    [040326] Release wrapped - public release tag is "20040301" for executable
             and macros.

    [040326] Support for MAC O/S Darwin image.  Console only (no build machine
             available for X-11 version).

    [040326] Introduction of UPX on Windows and DOS executables for ne only.

    [040326] Support  for MS-DOS  long name under  DJGPP v2.0. For version 2.0
             then the DJGPP  functions  must be invoked rather than the MS-DOS
             BIOS calls otherwise the modified short name is returned. DJGPPv1
             is still supported original definitions maintained.

    [040326] Added  "filetype"  macro to  determine  the file type of  MS-DOS,
             Windows or UNIX.

    [040322] $mouse  variables  configured under console modes to allow pseudo
             mouse operations to be performed.

    [040322] Fixed the win32s  build and  emain.h  definitions.  Mouse was not
             supported   under   win32s   through   incorrect    configuration
             definition.

    [040322] Key  bindings  for the file  browser.  ENTER now  handled  on the
             reserved  fields  to sort.  BACKSPACE  now  moves up a  directory
             level.

    [040322] Changed the  interface  to CVS, ftp and  file-browser  command so
             that if a numeric  argument of 0 is given then the directory tree
             window is not opened, just the *files* buffer.

    [040322] AutoIt hook. Thanks to Dr Detlef Groth.

    [040322] Added CSS template. Thanks to Gabriel Tabares-Barreiro.

    [040318] Fix to Microsoft Windows clipboard when operating with VNC.

    [040317] Macro and source release set to "20040301".

    [040317] Added "find" command to macro set.

    [040317] Corrected  "rgrep" to use the  "%find-com" to specify the find(1)
             command.

    [040310] Fix to graphical diff ("gdiff").  Occasions where all changes had
             been   accepted  and  the  changes  could  not  be  saved.  gdiff
             incorrectly prompted user to accept all changes first.

    [040310] Support  for  multiple   comment  styles  in  the  same  language
             template.   Additional   comment   styles  are   defined  in  the
             "hkXXX.emf" file with the syntax ".fhook-XXX.comment-N" where "N"
             is an  integer  starting  for 1 to n,  the  number  of  different
             comment styles. Templates  updated to use multiple comment styles
             where appropriate (C, C++ and SQL).

    [040310] Support the 'r' flag in  ".fhook-XXX.comment"  flag field. Causes
             the key  binding to "esc-o" and "esc-q" to restyle  the  comment.
             All templates updated to include the flag where appropriate.

    [040310] CVS  operates   asynchronously  using  ipipes.  Refresh  problems
             resolved.

    [040310] narrow-search-forward  bound  to "C-c s",  narrow-search-backward
             bound to "C-c r".

    [040308] "ipipe-shell-command"  includes  additional  flag  to run in "raw
             mode"  where the buffer is not  annotated  and wrap is  disabled.
             Additional argument added to command to allow the "$buffer-ipipe"
             macro to be defined when the pipe is defined. Corrected operation
             of pipe-shell-command  where "ipipe" automatically  degrades to a
             "pipe" (Windows only), if degraded then the "$buffer-ipipe" macro
             is still invoked on completion.

    [040226] Deleted  "cygnus.emf"  added  "cygwin.emf"  for cygwin BASH shell
             support under Windows.  Corrected the shell  operation with macro
             layer for echo and completion.

    [040224] Add new 'narrow out unhilighted lines' feature.

    [040223] Add new buffer tab list tool-bar tool for rapid access to buffers
             via a top or bottom tool-bar.

    [040223] Add <> buttons to tool-bar mode lines to scroll left and right.

    [040223] Fixed. Calender day is off by one when going  backwards to before
             2004.

    [040223] Fixed.  Executing 'me' (user-setup -> Current) breaks  auto-spell
             until  a main  spell  command  (spell-word  or  spell-buffer)  is
             executed.

    [040223] CVS directory listing file loss solved.  Differences  between CVS
             command line  operations and directory list operations  resolved,
             both now produce the same results.

    [040229] Fixed UNIX signal lock synchronization, solves problems with read
             failing following FTP or HTTP command.

    [040223] Add   new   narrow-search-forward   and    narrow-search-backward
             commands.

    [040220] Mouse wheel operation fixed. Added new mouse-wup-scroll  commands
             that should be used instead.

    [040218] Added 'Invert Selection' to context menu.

    [040218] Add 'f5' refresh binding to a dir list buffer.

    [040218] Fixed. Need some way of opening the right mouse button menu using
             a key. Also need so  termcap  bindings  to open main and  context
             menus.  Created new  context-menu  command, bound to S-f1 and the
             windows  'menu' key (aka windows) and created  binds to open main
             menu (esc =) and context menu (esc +) on termcap platforms.

    [040217] Fixed.  '2   popup-window'   does  not  work  on  an   XTerm,  no
             implementation in function meFrameXTermMakeCur.

    [040217] Fixed. CVS status of  directories  is not shown. Also add 'b' and
             'o' file type flags.

    [040216] Fixed.  ME   build.bat   -l  options  do  not  work  in  standard
             cmd/command as there use 4DOS '>>&'  extension.  Changed to using
             2>&1 which works on cmd & 4nt but breaks 4Dos and command.

    [040216] Fixed   bottom   tool-bar   window  grows  when  CVS  is  opened,
             change-window-depth does not respect bit 2 of $window-flags.

    [040214] Added .spec template for RedHat RPM package file specification.

    [040214] Added .psf template for HP-UX depot product file specification.

    [040214] Recognize -* makefile -*- and -* sh -*-

             seen from a small window.

    [040213] PHP script can be started with '<?' tag in a php file.

    [040213] Corrected  UNIX  ishell  operation  when  "su" to  another  user.
             Locking up or generally  behaving badly (termio not initialized).
             Affects all UNIX platforms.

    [040213] Documented the create/delete/next-frame keys.

    [040210] Fixed toolbar  Directory  File List does not contain "../" - UNIX
             only.

    [040210] Fixed. On UNIX only the $progname may not be fully  expanded (has
             just  "me")  which  may lead to a ctags  generation  error and an
             alternate fix to $search-path.

    [040210] Fixed. On unix,  find-file  of a symbolic  link which points to a
             directory  results  in a bad dir  listing.  The  list of files is
             correct but the stats are all wrong (found on sunos 5.8).

    [040210] Fix subtle ftp bug with alias ftp  addressed.  Create an ftp site
             "ftp://test/" say with user name foo and passwd bar and then load
             in  "ftp://test/dir1/"  the buffer file name is correctly  set as
             "ftp://test/dir1/" but the 'Directory listing of:' line is set to
             "ftp://foo@test/dir1/". Firstly the user may wish the 'foo' to be
             hidden but secondly with the  introduction of being able to click
             on the 'Directory  listing of:' line this has introduced a subtle
             inefficiency/bug,  if I  click  on the  'foo@test'  ME will  load
             "ftp://foo@test/"  not "ftp://test/"  which to ME is a completely
             different  file. This can in turn lead to  "ftp://foo@test/dir1/"
             being  loaded  so you can end up with 2 copies of every dir being
             loaded! The fix is to make the  'Directory  listing of:' line the
             same, i.e. "ftp://test/dir1/"

    [040208] Fixed.  "-n"  command  line  option to a console  build  causes a
             option failure and the executable does not run.

    [040208] Corrected  UNIX jasspa tree search when  executable is in CWD and
             there is no executable path.

    [040206] RC4 - Release Candidate 4 - MicroEmacs '04

    [040206] Fixes for tool-bar Buffer Item List update problem. Thanks to Dr.

             revised and lookup simplified.

    [040203] "user-setup" changed name to "Rebind Home Keys" for re-binding of
             home and end keys to  start/end  of line.  Removed  "C-v" binding
             that existed with old "MS keys" label.

    [040203] Reworked all user defined defined  directory save locations, ftp,
             spell, etc..

    [040203] Corrected osf1, openBSD and zaraus emf files.

    [040203] Added "%cvs-com" variable to define the CVS command.

    [040203] XML template extended to include javascript.

    [040130] 2nd  iteration of prototype  and near final  revision of new user
             setup.

             Following  an internal  review of RC3 then it has been decided to
             address the issues of user configuration prior to a full release.
             This  specifically  addresses  the  location  of user  MicroEmacs
             configuration  directories  and search paths. User  configuration
             has  traditionally  required the setting of external  environment
             variables  such as "$MEPATH" and for the user to create a private
             directory to store user  settings. This is proving  difficult for
             new  users who just want to run the  editor.  RC4 and  subsequent
             releases will address these  problems by determining  the correct
             location for configuration files and create the appropriate files
             and directories under user control.

             The net result of these  changes  should  significantly  simplify
             installation and setup as follows:

             * All platforms will be able to run without any manual user setup
               or  the   requirement  for  specific   MicroEmacs   environment
               variables.

             * User  defined  directories  and  configuration  files  will  be
               created under editor control on detecting a new user.

             * Existing   installations   using   $MEPATH  will  be  backwards
               compatible with the new build.

             * All  platforms  now  support a searching  jasspa  sub-directory
               structure   of   company  /   spelling   /  macros.   This  was
               traditionally   limited   to   the   Windows   Install   Shield
               installation but has been extended across all platforms.

             * Two new  environment  variables are provided for user or system
               administrator use. "$MEINSTALLPATH" defines the location of the
               MicroEmacs  standard macros and allows the built in search path
               to be  overridden.  "$MEUSERPATH"  defines the  location of the
               user  private  configuration  directory  and allows the user to
               locate  their  private  directory  in different  location. In a
               standard install neither of these variables will be required.

             * The Microsoft  Windows system defined  application path will be
               used  for user  configuration  files.  This is  applicable  for
               roaming  users where the  application  directory is stored on a
               server.

             * The use of the me32.ini file on MicroSoft Windows  environments
               is not required, but is still supported.

             * The UNIX path searching is improved. /usr/local/microemacs will
               be depreciated and replaced with  /usr/local/jasspa in addition
               other  standard path  locations are supported on a per-platform
               basis.

             * On UNIX then the directory  "~/.jasspa"  shall contain the user
               configuration  files.  Optionally  the "company" / "spelling" /
               "macros"  sub-directories  may be  included  in this  directory
               where access to the system  directory  locations by the user is
               not permitted.

             * Concept of guest has been removed.  "guest.emf" and "guest.erf"
               removed   replaced  with  "newuser".   "user-setup"  no  longer
               supports setting of name.

             * Internal variables "$user-name" and "$user-path" are defined.

    [040128] Fixed re-style for C/C++ comments in vertical alignment.

    [040123] "user-setup" mouse button selection fixed.

    [040123] "C-x 3" mapped to "split-window-horizontally" , "C-x 5" mapped to
             "create-frame".

             operates correctly following a fold.

    [040119] "narrow-buffer"   numeric   argument  and  command  line  options
             extended for mark-up lines.

    [030917] CVS. Major revamp of CVS support including an OSD dialog for each
             tool.

    [030917] Changed the CHAR defines and add defines for the LEADER and TRAIL
             bytes used for special chars.  Re-implemented OSD hot-keys to use
             "\\H"  instead  of "&" and  added new "\\{" and "\\}" to stop and
             start  current  item  hilighting.  Added  support for C++ private

             "sort-lines" and "transpose-line".

    [030710] Changed  some define names to make them  compatible.  Changed the
             calls to  "meGetUserKey" to "meGetKey" so a macro can give a list
             of keys Added new 0 argument  which  quits at the EOB rather than
             going to the top of the buffer etc (used in page-file "isearch").

    [030710] Changed  the  logic  of the 'd'  flag  so  that it  disables  the
             displaying of the item type, changed button  rendering so that it
             adheres to this so a single char button can be created  Added new
             'O' combo box item type  which is a mixture  between an entry box
             and a sub-menu item.

    [030710] Improved  the special  char drawing  routines so that they remain
             inside the char space and triangles look good regardless of size.

    [030710] Fixed a nasty bug to do with file hooks that load other files and
             the find-file command manipulating the buffHistNo  incorrectly so
             the wrong buffer is shown - obscure!

    [030625] Added macro release makefile.

    [030625] MicroEmacs 3.8 compatibility. Fixed isearch emulation.

    [030625] First revision of page-file.

    [030625] CVS. Removed debug line.

    [030610] Changed TAB and BELL to safer  defines.  Optimized  the fill-para
             function so that it keeps one of the existing  spaces between the
             words, this also help preserve the position of anchors.

    [030610] Package making files for SunOS.

    [030608] Changed the mouse default behavior to do a move yank.

    [030608] Tools. Removed superfluous endif.

    [030608] Tool-bar.  Only update the tool-bar if its the top level command,
             i.e. the screen-update is not required due to spell-buffer (say).

    [030608] MS-Shift  region. Check for  kill-rectangle  and treat like we do
             the kill-region.

    [030608] Added  new -ve  argument  to  insert-file  which  inserts  only a
             section of the file.  Optimized  the file-op  move command to try
             just moving the file first.

    [030608] Changed  the  addLine  function  so it  always  flags the line as
             changed,  this avoids some bizarre  issues when macros  delete an
             insert  lines of text  (best  shown by the  buffer-info  tool-bar
             tool).

    [030608] Added new macro oriented  buffer-info numeric argument. Fixed bug
             in the ignore white-space buffer compare.

    [030608] Fixed default printer selection issues - not complete.

    [030608] Fixed a minor debug build issue in undo.c.

    [030608] Changed the history so it always removes any duplicate entries.

    [030608] Added "$window-eline" and moved the aline into extended version.

    [030608] Changing  the  addLine  function  to always set the changed  flag
             meant all macros became hidden, use different bits.

             problems.

             static initialization.

             etc.

    [030515] Printer.   Store   the   windows   device   information   in  the
             print-history as well.

    [030514] JST  Template.  Fixed  jst magic  hook and added  Imakefile  one.
             Changed  jst magic  hook  variable  setting  setup to use the new
             $result variable.

    [030514] HTML   Template.   Changed   html-fold   ->  collapse,   reported
             goto-matching-tag failure.

    [030514] Buffer  initialization.  Changed the  fold-setup  call so that it
             gets  called if likely to be required - use the new  buffer-fhook
             $result setting to help in determining this.

    [030514] Folding.  Changed the  fold-setup so a setup string can be passed
             in  rather  than  searching  for  one  in the  buffer,  aimed  at
             utilizing the new buffer-fhook "$result" setting.

    [030514] Set  "$result" to the magic fhook  string so the fhook macro does
             not have to search for it again in buffer.c.

    [030514] Fixed "\xb" bad regex bug.

    [030513] Search. Added region line highlighting support.

             scheme to avoid printing issues.

    [030513] Removed old  hkfold.emf  fold  implementation.  Moved fold.emf to
             collapse.emf  and added a real folding editor support macros to a
             new fold.emf, based loosely on "fue".

    [030513] Abbreviation, Changed copy-region call to not expand the narrows.

    [030513] Latex Template. Added latex chars etc to the .eaf file.

    [030513] Search. Changed to handle the fold-open and fold-close split.

             use alpha mark.

    [030513] VM Mail. Regex protected the boundary id string.

             matching and added close tag feature.

    [030513] Buffer setup.  Changed fold -> collapse and added proper  folding
             setup entries.

    [030513] Commenting. Fixed silly "\\x80" alpha char label bug.

    [030513] File Dialogue. Added tab ordering to dialog.

    [030513] Folding all templates.  Changed the function  folding commands to
             collapse to avoid confusion with real folding.

    [030513] XML Template, Added indent rules for "<? ... ?>".

    [030513] Mouse. Changed the column setting to use alpha marks.

    [030513] Color  Schemes.  Split  the  fold  scheme  into   fold-close  and
             fold-open.

    [030512] Fixed  display  matching  fence issue with poke screen hiding the
             cursor on Unix X-Windows. May need to be done on MS-DOS as well.

    [030512] Fixed  horrid crash caused in search.c by buffer  change in macro
             followed by query replace and toolbar up-date  changing the regex
             variables.

    [030512] Fixed fill-paragraph when no arg is given but at the beginning of
             para still move forward.

    [030512] Build fix for SunOS.

    [030512] Ipipe fix for SunOS.

    [030512] Changedthe  line  flag  implementation  to be more  flexible  and
             variable in size so UE has a smaller memory usage and ME has line
             flags available.

    [030512] Improved the AMark setting and deleting.

    [030512] Added a Protected  Line flag and vastly  improved the  narrowing.
             Renamed most function in line.c to make them more readable.

    [030512] Big return value change to get functions  consistent - found that
             the return values of low level line functions  where different to
             high level functions  making the code hard to read and dangerous.
             Also needed a  consistent  triple  value  return  (true false and
             error) so change meABORT to -1 across the board.

    [020523] Added left and right truncate chars to  $window-chars,  fix ABORT

    [020523] Added extra parameter to HideBuffer  flagging whether to hide the
             buffer if the  window  buffer  lock is set.  Changed  find-buffer
             numerical  arg so -1 hides all but lock windows, -2 or less hides
             all.

    [020430] Improved  the 'closest  window  match'  algorithm  so it gets the
             closest window!

    [020427] Major  edit!  Added  frame  support,  standardized  many  of  the
             structure and function names, introduced  $window-flags  (not the

    [011028] Tweaked the "@fs" variable to improve its usability.

    [011028] set-position can now store the mark position.

    [011028] Fixes to windows file times.

    [011016] New caps-lock,  num-lock,  scroll-lock  and pause key support for
             win32  &  unix.  The  "*-lock"  implementation  to be  more  like
             "S-pick"  and  "C-pick" as the keys are  automatically  supported
             (like the shift) so there are no default  binds to void, the keys
             are only  generated if there are bound. Could not implement  this
             on MS-DOS.

    [011016] which  command  built  in i.e.  "M-x  which".  Used  for  command
             utilities.

    [011026] A new Hide value feature when inputting strings, this is now used
             be the crypt and ftp Password entry. The string is shown as '*'s.

    [011025] Utilized the latest screen-update  improvements to make the gdiff
             screen update rock solid.

    [011025] mlGetChar  fix. The key "return" was the 78th special  char, i.e.
             "SKEY_SPEC"|'N'   and  as  the   mlGetChar   did  not  check  the
             "SKEY_SPEC"  bits, pressing  return was like pressing 'N' so on a
             "Y/N" prompt try pressing return, its like saying No! .

    [011016] Spelling  dictionaries renamed with ISO naming scheme. Because of
             the language changes, you need to rename your personal dictionary
             to lsdpengb.edf for British and lsdpenus.edf for American.

    [011016] Hilighting  brackets/braces  as  requested  from  user  base. The
             hilight   braces   required   some   other   subtle   changes  to
             screen-update and show-region and the addition of the "rbin" mode
             means that this version is incompatible  with the last in quite a
             few areas.

    [011016] Fixed  mouse  handler  (turns out that if the pick event was lost
             (use "@cg" or an error) then me would lock!).

    [011016] Extended  control on indent tab and return  behavior (can disable
             the tab behavior).

    [011016] C++ name space indentation support.

    [011016] New language support  interface so spelling is not required for a
             language to be supported (may only want the basic  alphabet setup
             etc).

    [011016] Changed file loading  interface so all commands (like  view-file)
             can load in "bin", "crypt" or "rbin" mode.

    [010123] Reduced binary mode added (rbin).

4th Release - August 2001

    [010813] OSD bug fix for fixed size dialog boxes.

    [010812] Inclusion of occur regexp function.

    [010812] List function for  summarizing  file contents ("F7" / "Esc-F7" to
             close).

    [010810] Rendered character for the scroll bar - improves clarity.

    [010810] Modified the printer registry file location.

    [010801] New Guest default color scheme.

3rd Release - Minor Updates July 14th 2001 onwards

    [010718] LaTeX template includes incorrect bindings - fixed.

    [010716] Corrected  Windows  Install  Shield  "Company  Entry" + "Registry
             entry fields".

    [010716] Minor macros  modification to font selection for schemes. Default
             guest setup font selection for cleaner 'first' page.

    [010716] CVS  macro  update.   Changed   "cvs-diff"  to  "cvs-gdiff"   and
             introduced  a new  "cvs-diff"  which just gives the "diff" output
             and fixed several bugs when running with a CVS server. Also added
             support for the CVS/Template file when committing.

    [010716] Minor  update  to  the  CVS  help  page  for  the  aforementioned
             (Affected all help files).

3rd Release - July 2001

    [010713] New style WWW JASSPA Pages.

    [010712] Added    comment   and   menu   support   for   MS-DOS   and   M4
             (hkdos.emf/hkm4.emf).

    [010711] Added hpux11 support.

    [010711] Fixed windows erase when file doesn't exist problems.

    [010710] Removed  cbox  -  replaced  by  generic  comment   implementation
             (cbox.emf/me.ehf).

    [010710] Added a 'Plain  Text'  char set  which  only uses  plain  letters
             (charset.emf).

    [010710] Fixed  many  little  comment   formatting   bugs  and  annoyances
             (comment.emf).

    [010710] Changes required to build on MS-DOS using DJGPP v1.

    [010705] Bug fix for windows rendering crash.

    [010630] Minor reorder to X-Windows initialization for cygwin X-Server.

    [010507] Added   generic   commands   for  the   creation,   deletion  and
             reformatting of comments now used by most of the file hooks.

    [010412] Added new generic  buffer  setup, menu and help macros,  creating
             the new  buffer-setup(3)  command. Ported all existing file hooks
             to this new interface greatly reducing the buffer hook size while
             increasing its functionality and consistency.

    [010402] Added support for new $buffer-backup(5)  variable for setting the
             back-up file location.

    [010312] Support  for  new key  bindings  allowing  CU  emulations.  Nedit
             bindings  provided as example.  Major work to enable the complete
             re-binding of all keys so the user interface to MicroEmacs can be
             completely  changed, this allows for example a Windows feel to be
             created. This  required many internal  ghosts to be exorcized and
             add new macro functions.

    [010308] User buffer configuration menu added.

    [010308] Improved Python support (Contribution PG).

    [010304] Bug fixes to hilighting logic.

    [010228] Improved dialog box for search/replace.

    [010210] Revised  programming  language  templates;  simplified the common
             elements used in configuring the templates.

    [010202] Added new  command-wait(2)  command to enable  macros to wait for
             user dependent completion, used in "gdiff".

    [010202] Changed     buffer     variables     to    except     the    form
             ":<buffer-name>:<variable>",  like command variables. This allows
             macros to access variable not defined in the current buffer.

    [010126] File "autosave" location changes. Control save name and location.

    [001005] OSD speedups.

    [001005] Improved and  increased  the file system  operations  via the new
             file-op(2) command, created better menus in the file-browser(3).

    [001010] Revamped the main ftp GUI to make it work much more rationally.

    [001010] Improved ipipe-shell-command efficiency on Windows by introducing
             a new thread approach to listen for activity. Implemented a shell
             command-line in an ipiped environment so ishell(3) command is now
             usable on Windows platforms.

    [001010] Added  new  set-position(2)  which  can  be  used  to  store  all
             information about the current window and  goto-position(2)  which
             will  then  restore  them.  Allowed   macros  to  use  non-letter
             characters  for alpha marks and  positions so they no longer need
             to clobber user ones.

    [001010] Added new "-k" and "-u"  command-line  options and  improved "-s"
             option.

    [000922] Added GUI for tag dialog for tags generation.

    [000922] Recursive tags support (i.e. nested directory tag traversal).

    [000810] emain.h "#define"'s properly supported again so MicroEmacs can be
             successfully  compiled  without  options  like SPELL and OSD etc.
             This can reduce the binary size by up to 37%.

    [000718] Source trees now maintained under CVS.

    [000719] Improved TCL/TK and Perl template support.

    [000704] Improved FTP and HTTP support.

    [000620] Java tags support.

    [000503] Revised printer support.

    [000503] Color printer support (Lexmark).

    [000322] Support for BSD 4.2/4.3.

    [000322] Revised UNIX Termcap support.

    [000322] New font rendering,  supporting bold, italic,  underline etc. All
             platforms   modified  to  cope  with  font  scheme   definitions.
             Platforms optimized for speed.

    [000126] Beta build revision contains version information for 2000/01/26.

    [000126] Directory  file copy. Within this release  files in the directory
             listings  may be selected for copy and pasting from the menu. Use
             the right mouse button to pop-up a menu in the directory buffers.
             Copy and paste  to/from a ftp  directory  buffer to a local drive
             buffer  may be used to  initiate  an ftp  transfer.  (This is how
             these pages are uploaded).

    [000126] New  command ftp opens a ftp  connection  using a dialog. Use may
             save the host  connection  information  in a registry  file. Note
             that the password information is exposed so be careful where this
             is used - if in doubt do not enter the  password  and you will be
             prompted.

    [000126] New  command  "uniq"  operates as the UNIX of the same name. used
             with sort, and reduces to unique lines.

    [000126] Character  translation; addition of character  translation macros
             when  moving  between  character  sets.  Accessible  from Menu ->
             Format -> Change Buffer Char Set.

    [000126] Support for  additional  character  sets, Windows  GREEK, Windows
             TURKISH.

    [000126] Line  hilighting  selection  with the use of the  mouse  and auto
             search.  When  using  the  mouse  selection  to  set up the  line
             hilighting when invoked from a

             > right-mouse -> Hilight Line -> color/remove

             selection; the macro  determines  the mouse  selected  region and
             makes an  appropriate  decision  as to how the line  highlighting
             scheme is to be applied. The  following  rules apply to the mouse
             selection:-

             * Point in line selected (i.e. mark == point)  Highlight the line
               only.

             * Region  in the line  selected.  Both  point and mark are on the
               same line. Extract the selected  text and  highlight  all lines
               that  match the  search  pattern.  The color  "remove"  is also
               pattern matched to selectively remove lines.

             * Region  selected  mark & point on different  lines Block up the
               region with appropriate highlight.

             Note  that  line  highlighting  may be  safely  used in a  folded
             buffer.

    [000126] Addition of special rendered space character. You may toggle this
             from the keyboard using a macro in your user.emf as follows:-

             > ; Macro to enable the display of TAB/CR. Note that we
             > ; force the screen to be updated.
             > define-macro tab-display
             > set-variable $system &bxor $system 0x80000
             > screen-update
             > !emacro
             > global-bind-key "tab-display" "f11"

    [000126] Documentation update on new features (contained in me.ehf).

    [000114] Fixed font selection bug in 000112 beta.

    [000112] Revised color highlighting  schemes, reduced the number of colors
             in a number of schemes. Introduction of the Sherwood Forest color
             scheme (green theme obviously !!).

    [000112] Small  revision  to the  user  interface  with  respect  to  font
             selection. In order to make  character set selection  easier then
             the  multiple  choices for the box  characters  have been removed
             from Menu -> Help -> User Setup. These have been  replaced with a
             new check box  Extended  Char Set. This box  should be checked to
             enable  the  special  rendering  characters  and  enable  the box
             characters  -  this  is  typically   enabled  on  X-Windows   and
             MS-Windows.

    [000112] Provision for directory list sorting on name,  modification  time
             and size. Selecting the directory column title performs a re-sort
             based on the selection, a further selection reverses the order of
             the list.

    [000112] Addition of ftp support (meu build on Windows, enabled by default
             on UNIX).  Enables  files to be  edited  via ftp, (read and write
             supported).      Transfer     to     another     system     using
             ftp://[<user>[:<password]@]><host>[:<port>]/<pathname>.

    [000112] Improved  source code  provision for foreign  languages,  various
             internal  problems.  Support for Russian  (Windows  and  Cyrillic
             koi8-r).

    [000112] Y2K problems with time stamping and mode line date.

    [000112] New spelling rules for number sequences and specialized wild card
             sequences. Within the rule file (i.e. americar.emf, britishr.emf,
             etc.) then the following spelling rules may be added to cope with
             numeric  sequences.  The addition of these rules will spell check
             hexadecimal sequences and validate numeric sequences such as 1st,
             2nd, 3rd etc. A  spelling  of "1nd"  would  generate  a  spelling
             error.  This  has not  been  performed  for  other  languages  so
             submissions for other language equivalents would be appreciated.

             > ; Add some special word rules to make life easier.
             > ; These are for 1st, 2nd 3rd etc.
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?1\\(st\\|ST\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?2\\(nd\\|ND\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "\\([0-9]*[02-9]\\)?3\\(rd\\|RD\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*1[0-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "[0-9]*[04-9]\\(th\\|TH\\)"
             > add-spell-rule "*" "0[xX][[:xdigit:]]+"
             > ; Spell rules for unit definitions.
             > ; These are for 50Mb, 10Kg, -45.56cm 12ft 10.00am 16.00pm etc.
             > add-spell-rule "*" "-?\\([0-9]*.\\)?[0-9]+\\(Kg\\|Kb\\|Gb\\|Tb\\|Mb\\|mm\\|cm\\|m\\|Km\\|ft\\|inch\\|mph\\|lb\\|am\\|pm\\)"

    [000112] Box selection copy and paste. Bindings are defined as:-

             > Esc C-w kill-rectangle
             > Esc C-y yank-rectangle

    [000112] Enhanced info file  highlighting  (Thanks to Dr. Detlef Groth for
             this).

    [000112] New copy-file  command,  typically used by the macro language for
             moving files around.

    [000112] Error  reporting  of bad  command  line  arguments  in  Microsoft
             Windows environment (Thanks to Pedro Gomes for this).

2nd Release - November 1999

    [991101] Enhanced the latex support macros following various contributions
             from users.

    [991101] Added  Favorites  to the File  pull down  menu.  This is a simple
             mechanism to allow the user to add a file to a favorites list.

    [991101] Ground  up  implementation  of  the  regular  expression  pattern
             matcher,  following  licensing  problems  with the GNU regex. The
             resultant  pattern  matcher is now a little faster than GNU regex
             and is capable of all of the standard regular  expression pattern
             matches. The pattern matcher has diverged from GNU in that double
             backslashes  are required in the character  classes [..] to allow
             for escape sequence short cuts such as '\n' (newline), '\t' (tab)
             etc. It was felt that this  compromise  was better than having to
             quote the more obscure search characters.

    [991101] Changed the  highlighting  and  indenting  syntax to be GNU regex
             compliant.

    [991101] Modified  compare-windows  to  ignore  white  space  by  default,
             compare-windows-exact  performs an exact  character for character
             comparison.

    [991101] Enhanced the tags support to handle  multiple  tags and recursive
             directory tree searching.

    [991101] Implemented  osd-help,  a GUI  front  end  to the  on-line  help.
             Required  changes to the help system which gives macros access to
             the on-line help buffer, needed for the index and search.

    [991101] Over-hauled the  highlighting  scheme files and editor to support
             the disabling of buffer highlighting.

    [991101] Many bugs fixed on all platforms, in particular  UNIX cutting and
             pasting (crashes exceed) and focus problems and NT exit delay.

    [991101] Added tab and newline character printing in buffers.

    [991101] Introduced message line variables "@mx" and "@mxa".

    [991101] New  Games  -  Crossword  cracker.  The  ideal  way to  cheat  at
             crosswords.  Uses the spelling  dictionary  to guess at the word,
             given a number of known letters.

    [991101] Hook  file  protection  against  globally  bound  keys - prevents
             re-binding of user defined keys within the macro.

    [991101] Search/Replace  fix for exact mode.  Environment  variable search
             path fix.

    [991101] hkm4.emf  added  back  into  the  release  (seemed  to have  gone
             missing).

    [991101] Cut and  paste  fix when  running  the UNIX  version  through  an
             X-Server such as Exceed in the Windows environment.

    [991101] Plain text printer device added.

    [991101] Obscure OSD fix.

    [991101] New OSD help search facility Menu->Help->General Help.

    [991101] Fix for NT  hang-up  on shut  down  (typically  encountered  when
             running a source debugger).

    [991101] Fix for NT process spawning with spaces in the names.

    [991101] Metris macro fix, OSD bug fix, NT display fix.

    [991101] New - color scheme, GVim look.

    [991101] New - Unix/Linux support for Wheel Mouse (mouse.emf).

    [991101] New - Color  schemes,  Plain;  for those  that do not care for an
             abundance of colors.

    [991101] Modified the numeric  key-pad  behavior to be  consistent  on all
             platforms.   Problems  were  noted  with  the  UNIX  number  lock
             orientation which was reversed.

    [991101] New - Color  scheme  variables  which  allow  the hkXXX  files to
             determine the level of highlighting to apply to their templates.

    [991101] Line  length fix; more  graceful  behavior  (i.e. does not crash)
             when the line length exceeds 64K.

    [991101] Intercept  the windows 105 keyboard  application  key  (typically
             right hand side of keyboard  next to the control key). The key is
             called  "menu". By default  this is bound in  win32.emf,  however
             users may bind it as a prefix for their own key  combinations  in
